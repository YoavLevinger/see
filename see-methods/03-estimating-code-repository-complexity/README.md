Estimating **code complexity** in order to infer **development effort or time** is a nuanced and semi-scientific process. Here's a structured, scientific approach that combines **software engineering metrics**, **empirical models**, and **statistical reasoning**.

---

### üî¨ Step 1: **Measure Code Complexity**
Use established software complexity metrics:

#### 1. **Size Metrics**:
- **Lines of Code (LOC)** ‚Äì total, code-only, comments
- **Number of files, classes, functions**

#### 2. **Complexity Metrics**:
- **Cyclomatic Complexity** (McCabe): measures the number of independent paths through the code.
- **Halstead Metrics**: based on operators and operands to estimate effort and volume.
- **Cohesion & Coupling**: especially for OOP or modular code.

#### 3. **Object-Oriented Metrics**:
- **WMC** (Weighted Methods per Class)
- **DIT** (Depth of Inheritance Tree)
- **LCOM** (Lack of Cohesion in Methods)

Use tools like:
- `radon`, `lizard`, `cloc` (Python)
- `SonarQube`, `Understand`, or `CodeScene` (multi-language, industrial level)

---

### üìä Step 2: **Use Empirical Estimation Models**
Translate complexity into estimated effort:

#### 1. **COCOMO / COCOMO II**:
- Based on LOC or Function Points + adjustment factors.
- Outputs estimated person-months.
  
Example (basic COCOMO):
```text
Effort = a * (KLOC)^b
```
Where `a` and `b` depend on project type (organic, embedded, etc.).

#### 2. **Function Points Analysis (FPA)**:
- Measures *functionality delivered* rather than code size.
- Classifies inputs, outputs, interfaces, and files.
- Converts into effort using standardized tables.

#### 3. **Use Case Points (UCP)**:
- Based on the number and complexity of use cases and actors.
- Good for high-level estimation before coding starts.

---

### üß† Step 3: **Contextual Calibration**
Factors to adjust based on reality:
- Team experience and size
- Technology familiarity
- Tooling and automation
- Code reuse
- Requirements volatility
- Test coverage (auto tests vs. manual)

---

### üìà Step 4: **Compare Against Benchmarks**
- Look at **open-source projects** with known histories.
- Use Git logs (e.g., commit dates, author count) to estimate real durations.
- Use **SLOC-per-month** benchmarks:
  - ~100‚Äì500 LOC per developer per month (industry rough average, varies wildly)

---

### üß™ Optional: Machine Learning Estimators
Train models using:
- Code metrics as input
- Real project effort (person-months or hours) as output

You can use models like:
- Linear regression
- Decision trees
- Neural networks

These methods require a dataset of past projects (e.g., ISBSG or personal repo data).

---

### üßæ Deliverable
A well-structured scientific report might include:
1. Summary of codebase (language, size, domain)
2. Complexity metrics extracted
3. Estimation model(s) applied
4. Assumptions and calibration factors
5. Final effort/time estimate
6. Confidence interval or error margin

---
Creating your **complexity formula** based on measurable code characteristics is a great scientific approach. Here's a step-by-step method to help you **devise a composite code complexity formula**.

---

## üîß Step 1: **Define Inputs (Metrics to Use)**

Start with measurable and meaningful indicators. Common ones include:

| Metric                     | Symbol | What it Measures                                         |
|---------------------------|--------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| Lines of Code             | `LOC`  | Code volume                                              |
| Cyclomatic Complexity     | `CC`   | Control flow branching                                   |
| Halstead Volume           | `HV`   | Size and difficulty based on operations & operands       |
| Number of Functions       | `NF`   | Modularity, callable units                               |
| Average Function Length   | `AFL`  | Granularity and potential maintainability                |
| Depth of Inheritance Tree | `DIT`  | OO complexity                                            |
| Coupling Between Objects  | `CBO`  | Degree of interdependence                                |
| Lack of Cohesion (LCOM)   | `LCOM` | Internal consistency of methods within a class           |

You can select only a subset depending on the codebase type (procedural, OO, etc.)

---

## üìê Step 2: **Normalize the Metrics**

To make them comparable:
- Convert all metrics to a 0‚Äì1 or 0‚Äì10 scale (e.g., min-max normalization).
- Or use z-scores if you have multiple samples.

Example:
```text
LOC_norm = (LOC - LOC_min) / (LOC_max - LOC_min)
```

---

## üßÆ Step 3: **Design the Formula**

Now, devise a **weighted formula**:

```text
Complexity Score (C) = w‚ÇÅ¬∑LOC_norm + w‚ÇÇ¬∑CC_norm + w‚ÇÉ¬∑HV_norm + w‚ÇÑ¬∑NF_norm + ...
```

Where:
- `w‚ÇÅ, w‚ÇÇ, w‚ÇÉ, ...` are weights summing to 1 (or 100%).
- You can determine weights based on:
  - Expert opinion
  - Statistical regression (see below)
  - Equal weight for initial prototype

### Optional:
Include non-linear terms if needed:
```text
C = w‚ÇÅ¬∑(CC^2) + w‚ÇÇ¬∑log(HV) + ...
```

---

## üìä Step 4: **Validate or Calibrate Weights**

If you have access to several codebases with known development effort or duration:

- Use **linear regression**:
  ```text
  Effort ~ a¬∑LOC + b¬∑CC + c¬∑HV + ...
  ```
- Or use **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)** to find dominant factors.
- If no ground truth is available, start with equal weights, then tweak based on sensitivity analysis.

---

## üìò Step 5: **Interpretation and Use**

Once you have a formula, you can:
- Use it to **rank codebases** or modules by complexity
- Correlate it with **development time, bug count**, or **team size**
- Apply thresholds (e.g., >0.7 = high complexity)

---

## üîÅ Example Formula (Prototype)

Here‚Äôs a simplified starting formula for general codebases:

```text
C = 0.3¬∑(LOC_norm) + 0.4¬∑(CC_norm) + 0.3¬∑(HV_norm)
```

If you want something a bit richer:

```text
C = 0.2¬∑(LOC_norm) + 0.3¬∑(CC_norm) + 0.2¬∑(HV_norm) + 0.1¬∑(NF_norm) + 0.2¬∑(LCOM_norm)
```

## üìÅ What You Can Get with Just the Codebase

If you have only a code repository (no Git history), you can **still extract**:
- LOC, comments
- Functions, classes, methods
- Cyclomatic complexity
- Halstead metrics
- Code cohesion, basic coupling
- Inheritance structure (for OO code)

---

## üìú Optional with Git Access

If you also have Git:
- **Code churn** (how often files are changed)
- **Development timeline** (time per feature/file)
- **Team activity** (contributors, commit frequency)

---


When working with a **GitHub repository**, you get access to **both the codebase** *and* its **version control history**. This unlocks **more metrics** than just static analysis.

Here‚Äôs a breakdown of **what you can extract from GitHub**, grouped by source type:

---

## üì¶ **From the Code (Static Metrics)**

These are extracted from the files directly (like if you downloaded the repo):

| Metric                           | Extractable from GitHub? | Notes / Tools |
|----------------------------------|---------------------------|---------------|
| **Lines of Code (LOC)**         | ‚úÖ Yes                    | `cloc`, `tokei`, `radon` |
| **Cyclomatic Complexity (CC)**  | ‚úÖ Yes                    | `radon`, `lizard`, `SonarQube` |

| **Comment Density**             | ‚úÖ Yes                    | `cloc`, `tokei` |
| **LCOM, CBO, Cohesion/Coupling**| ‚úÖ Partially              | `SonarQube`, `Understand` (more advanced) |

> ‚úÖ *You can extract all of these by cloning the repo locally.*

---

## ‚è≥ **From Git History (Temporal/Process Metrics)**

These come from **Git commit data**, which GitHub stores (and you can query via API or Git CLI):

| Metric                           | Extractable from GitHub? | Notes / Tools |
|----------------------------------|---------------------------|---------------|
| **Code Churn (lines added/removed over time)** | ‚úÖ Yes | `git log --stat`, `git churn`, `GitHub API` |
| **Commit Frequency**            | ‚úÖ Yes                    | `git log`, GitHub API |
