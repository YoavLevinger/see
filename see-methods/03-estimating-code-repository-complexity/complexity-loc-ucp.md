# Code-Only Effort Estimation Model (COEEM) ‚Äì Metric Weights Justification

## üìò Context from Sharma & Chaudhary (2023)

In their study *Prediction of Software Effort by Using Non-Linear Power Regression for Heterogeneous Projects*, Sharma & Chaudhary (2023) emphasize:

- LOC and Use Case Points (UCP) provide strong predictors when combined.
- Non-linear models outperform traditional linear ones.
- Power-regression based estimators minimize estimation error (MMRE).

These insights support a complexity-weighted, non-linear model for code-only effort estimation.

## üß† Why Each Metric is Weighted This Way

| Metric | Symbol | Weight | Academic Justification |
|--------|--------|--------|--------------------------|
| Lines of Code | `LOC` | 1.0 | Base size metric; useful but less predictive alone. Sharma & Chaudhary (2023) show it requires structural context. |
| Cyclomatic Complexity | `CCÃÑ` | 2.0 | Strong indicator of branching logic and fault proneness. Supported by Lavazza et al. (2023). |
| Halstead Volume | `HVÃÑ` | 1.0 | Reflects logical size and mental workload. Balanced weight due to syntax dependence. |
| Cognitive Complexity | `CoCoÃÑ` | 1.5 | Represents code readability and understandability. Moderate empirical support. |
| Function Count | `NF` | 1.0 | Linked to modularity and object-oriented structure. Mi≈°iƒá & Te≈°iƒá (1998). |
| AST Depth | `ASTdÃÑ` | 1.0 | Tree depth reflects code hierarchy and structure. Supported by Phan et al. (2018). |

## üìè Composite Complexity Formula

```math
C_{comp} = w_1 \cdot \frac{LOC}{1000} + w_2 \cdot \overline{CC} + w_3 \cdot \overline{HV} + w_4 \cdot \overline{CoCo} + w_5 \cdot \log(NF + 1) + w_6 \cdot \overline{ASTd}
```

Default Weights:
- `w‚ÇÅ=1`, `w‚ÇÇ=2`, `w‚ÇÉ=1`, `w‚ÇÑ=1.5`, `w‚ÇÖ=1`, `w‚ÇÜ=1`

## ‚è≥ PERT-Wrapped Effort Formula

```math
Effort_{days} = \frac{
0.75 \cdot C_{comp}^{0.85} + 4 \cdot C_{comp} + 1.25 \cdot C_{comp}^{1.15}
}{6}
```

This envelope models uncertainty using PERT (Program Evaluation Review Technique) aligned with power regression trends in Sharma & Chaudhary (2023).
