Comparison between the **original method** from the paper (using Paragraph Vector Algorithm and developer activity metrics) and the **SBERT-based implementation**

## üîç Comparison: Paper vs SBERT-Based Implementation

| Aspect | **Original Paper Method** | **SBERT-Based Implementation (This Chat)** |
|--------|----------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| **Embedding Model** | Paragraph Vector (PVA) | Sentence-BERT (`all-MiniLM-L6-v2`) |
| **Input** | Software description | Software description |
| **Vectorization** | Custom-trained paragraph vectors per project | Pretrained SBERT embeddings (semantic vectors) |
| **Similarity Metric** | Cosine similarity between PVA vectors | Cosine similarity between SBERT vectors |
| **Similarity Threshold** | Uses Œ±ÃÇ (threshold) and top-3 projects | Uses `top_k` (default = 5) most similar projects |
| **Effort Data Source** | Developer activity (developer count √ó duration) | Historical project efforts from `avg_repo_effort` table |
| **Effort Computation** | Weighted average using Walkerden‚Äôs triangle function: `Effort(z) = (3a + 2b + 1c)/6` | Weighted average based on similarity scores |
| **Weighting Logic** | Fixed weights (3,2,1) for top 3 matches | Dynamic weights = cosine similarity normalized |
| **Data Requirements** | Needs full developer history, SLOC, commit info | Only needs description + known effort values |
| **Reusability** | Requires retraining or manual embedding logic | Uses off-the-shelf SBERT + scalable similarity search |
| **Generalizability** | Tied to developer activity data availability | Generalizable to any project with a description |
| **Output** | Predicted effort (person-months) | Predicted effort (person-months) |

## üß† Summary

| Feature | Original Paper | SBERT-Based Version |
|--------|----------------|---------------------|
| üîé Data Required | Developer activity + description | Just description + known efforts |
| üß† Learning Approach | No ML model, only statistical similarity + handcrafted weights | Semantic embedding + similarity scoring |
| üõ† Flexibility | Limited to OSS with available developer activity | Works with any software description |
| üìà Scalability | Harder to scale (needs per-repo metadata) | Easily scalable with vector search/indexing |
| ‚úÖ Practical Use | Ideal for research with full access to commit history | Ideal for real-world input with limited metadata |

## üöÄ Verdict

Both methods are valuable, but:

- The **paper‚Äôs method** is grounded in classical effort modeling + activity data.
- The **SBERT implementation** is **more flexible, generalizable**, and easier to apply at scale with less data dependency.

**‚ÄúOSS Effort Estimation Using Software Features Similarity and Developer Activity-Based Metrics‚Äù**, here is a breakdown of the **method used for software effort estimation** and the **data fields involved**:

---

## ‚úÖ Method Used for Software Effort Estimation

The effort estimation method in this paper combines **software description similarity** with **developer activity metrics** from open-source software (OSS) repositories like GitHub.

### üîπ Step-by-step Summary:

1. **Collect Software Descriptions**  
   Descriptions are collected from the GitHub repositories (e.g., README content or project metadata).

2. **Vectorize Descriptions using PVA (Paragraph Vector Algorithm)**  
   Each description is embedded into a fixed-size dense vector using the Paragraph Vector Algorithm (similar to Word2Vec).

3. **Compute Similarity between Descriptions**  
   A new software's description is encoded and compared using cosine similarity with vectors of known projects.

4. **Select Top-k Most Similar Projects**  
   Projects with the highest cosine similarity (above a threshold Œ±ÃÇ) are selected as comparable historical examples.

5. **Retrieve Developer Activity-Based Effort Data**  
   For each similar project, developer activity info (number of developers, active time period) is used to calculate actual effort:
   \[
   \text{Effort} = |\text{Developers}| \times \text{Development Time}
   \]

6. **Predict Effort using Weighted Average**  
   The effort of the new software is predicted using a weighted average of the effort from similar projects using **Walkerden‚Äôs triangle function**:
   \[
   \text{Effort}(z) = \frac{3a + 2b + 1c}{6}
   \]
   Where _a, b, c_ are efforts of the 3 most similar projects.

## üìä Key Data Fields Used

### 1. **From the software descriptions**:
- `description` ‚Äì textual description of the project

### 2. **From the similarity model**:
- `vectorized_description` ‚Äì numerical embedding of the software description
- `cos_sim` ‚Äì cosine similarity score with the input description

### 3. **From developer activity metrics** (used for actual effort calculation):
| Field                  | Description                                                                 |
|------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `devCount`             | Number of developers working on the project                                 |
| `development_time`     | Duration of development (in days/months)                                    |
| `effort`               | Computed as `devCount √ó development_time`, typically in person-months       |
| `sloc_modifications`   | Lines of code added, deleted, or changed (used as a proxy for productivity)  |

## üß† Why This Method is Effective

- Avoids dependency on expert input or traditional metadata (which is often incomplete or missing)
- Uses natural language (description) for estimating effort
- Works well for OSS projects where developer activity can be tracked
