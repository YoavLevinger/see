Compile these into a JAR file. The JAR file parses JSON (it has error handling that will default to my Facebook API rest url if you don't give it an input parameter). The .bat batch file should be saved in the same folder as the .jar and your excel file. The .bat file outputs the parsed json array into a .csv file, which can be opened with excel. To use this with VBA, use the shell() function to call the batch file (the batch file calls the .jar file and outputs the result). Example: Shell(toCsv.bat ""json rest url""). Make sure within vba to also set your directory (before you call shell()), which can be done by writing the following: ChDir ThisWorkbook.path .

As in the previous lab, this lab provides you with a preconfigured Eclipse workspace (downloadable as a zip file from the course website) to get you started. The workspace contains several supporting files, which you do not need to touch, and a main file containing the beginnings of a parser specification using Beaver. The workspace also contains a rudimentary unit test suite, which you are encouraged to use and extend to test your implementation. Your assignment will be graded by the instructors using a unit test suite, so it is imperative that the code you hand in compiles and behaves correctly.",2018-02-28T16:27:33Z,2018-02-28 16:27:34,,7,0,5027,1,17,17,0.57,3636,12,3648,

Status Build codecov Lencana Kodifikasi  Server mengimplementasikan sebagian besar spesifikasi HTTP 1.1 dan menyediakan custom servlet API yang dapat digunakan untuk menangani halaman dinamis. API servlet dirancang setelah javax.servletAPI resmi namun tidak kompatibel. Laman dinamis mendukung cookie, sesi, unggahan file, dan hal lain untuk membangun aplikasi web umum.  Fitur utama Membangun aplikasi The http subproject dan ide di baliknya Pengujian mutasi Menjalankan server mandiri (CLI) Demo Kode sampel Server Hello World Meminta filter pencatatan Membangun deskriptor penyebaran Layar 500 jejak tumpukan kesalahan di browser Contoh skrip untuk mengirim SMS menggunakan utilitas wget command line Fitur utama Jejak kecil, tidak memerlukan perpustakaan eksternal Menangani permintaan HTTP dalam utas yang terpisah Menyediakan API servlet khusus untuk menghasilkan konten dinamis Mendukung metode GET, POST, HEAD (atau lebih, tergantung pada konfigurasi) Mendukung tipe transfer chunked Menyediakan dukungan penuh untuk tipe mime (menggunakan Apache seperti mime.type) Mendukung pengunggahan file yang di-buffer (permintaan multipart), cookie, sesi tetap Mendukung porsi tubuh parsial (rentang) Dapat menyajikan konten statis baik dari sistem file dan sumber daya APK Membangun aplikasi Pembungkus Gradle yang disediakan harus digunakan untuk membuat aplikasi:  ./gradlew build The http subproject dan ide di baliknya The http subproyek adalah jantung dari aplikasi dan itu adalah independen pada platform Android.  Bahkan aplikasi Android hanya merupakan upaya untuk menemukan penggunaan yang lebih praktis dari implementasi protokol HTTP eksperimental.  Salah satu tujuan desain adalah untuk menjaga artefak yang dihasilkan dalam ukuran kecil dan minimalis dalam hal ketergantungan pada perpustakaan lain - tidak memerlukan komponen pihak ketiga , semua implementasi protokol HTTP didasarkan pada parsing data yang dibaca dari soket TCP mentah.  Semua kode aplikasi ditargetkan ke Java 7. Ini juga dikompilasi untuk Android SDK versi <19 (coba dengan sumber daya tidak didukung, gunakan IOUtilities.closeSilently (closeable) di finallyblok sebagai alternatif ketika menutup aliran).  Setelah paket ro.polak.http cukup dewasa maka akan dirilis sebagai artifak independen.  Subproyek dapat diuji dengan cara berikut:  ./gradlew: http: bersih: http: periksa -PskipAndroidBuild Kode paket asli telah direfaktor dan ditutup dengan tes unit dan integrasi. Cakupan kode harus dijaga di atas 90%.  Pengujian mutasi Tes mutasi dapat dijalankan dengan mengeksekusi perintah berikut:  ./gradlew: http: clean: http: pitest -PskipAndroidBuild Hasilnya kemudian dapat ditemukan di bawah http/build/reports/pitest/ro.polak.http/index.htmldan http/build/reports/pitest/ro.polak.http/mutation.xml.  Menjalankan server mandiri (CLI) Server mandiri dapat digunakan untuk menggabungkan httpsubproject ke dalam implementasi server runnable. Sub proyek CLI juga independen pada platform Android, tidak dibundel dengan APK utama.  ./gradlew: cli: bootRun -PskipAndroidBuild Anda juga bisa membuat satu ""uber-jar"" dan menggunakannya sebagai aplikasi yang berdiri sendiri:  ./gradlew: cli: fatJar -PskipAndroidBuild Artefak yang dihasilkan kemudian dapat diambil ./cli/build/libs/cli-all.jar.  Stoples server yang berdiri sendiri dapat dijalankan pada mesin apa pun dengan perintah berikut:  java -jar ./cli/build/libs/cli-all.jar Antarmuka baris perintah0  Demo Aplikasi demo secara otomatis disebarkan ke Heroku dan dapat dihubungi di:  https://android-http-server-demo.herokuapp.com/example/ .

mitulmanish,Java-assignments," You are required to implement a basic Java program using Java (SE 5.0 or later). This assignment is designed to help you: 1. Practise your knowledge of class design in Java; 2. Practise the implementation of different kinds of OO constructs in Java; 3. Practise the use of polymorphism; 4. Practise error handling in Java; 5. Develop a reasonable sized application in Java.  General Implementation Details  All input data should be read from the standard input and all output data should be printed to the standard output. Do not use files at all.  If the input is formatted incorrectly, that input should be ignored and an appropriate error message should be displayed.  Marks will be allocated to your class design. You are required to modularise classes properly---i.e., to use multiple methods as appropriate. No method should be longer than 50 lines.  Marks will be allocated to proper documentation and coding layout and style. Your coding style should be consistent with standard coding conventions    . Overall Specification You will build out the system from Assignment 1 to manage multiple users purchasing different types of items, including discounts for multiple items. Items to be Purchased The TechStore has been extended to sell Software as well as Books. Like Books, Software can be sold as a (physical) CD or as an online item (i.e., download). As in Assignment 1, a Book can also be sold as a physical copy or as an ebook. You need to keep track of the physical copies of Books and CDs, and whether or not a title is available as an online item. Books have a title and an author; Software items have a title and a publisher. Each item is individually priced---i.e., the price depends on the title and whether it is a physical copy or ebook/software-download. Purchasing Items A User can buy any number of items (books, software, or a mix), adding one item at a time to their Shopping Cart. However, a User can only purchase up to a total of $100, unless they are a Member—if a non-Member User tries to add an item to their Shopping Cart that takes the total over their maximum then this is blocked. A Member has no limit. Items can be added and removed from a Shopping Cart until Checkout. When an Item is added to the Shopping Cart, the system checks that there are enough copies of it available; if an Item is added or removed from the Shopping Cart, the number of copies available must be updated. Checkout clears the Shopping Cart. Users Users can add Items to their Cart, up to their allowed limit (i.e., their Shopping Cart cannot store a total greater than the limit). A User has an id (must be unique) and password (you do NOT need to make these encrypted or secure), as well as a name and email address. A Member is a special kind of user: a Member has no limit on value they can store in their Cart. Once a User has spent a total of 10% more than their limit in total (this obviously must be over multiple Checkouts), then they are offered to become a Member—this offer is made straight after they Checkout with the items that takes them to 10% over their limit. An Administrator is a User that can perform special functions:  add to the number of copies of a (physical) Book or Software CD;  change the price of an item;  print sales statistics: i.e., number of sales (physical and electronic) of each Item;  add a new user—the system must checked that the new id is unique. Other Users do not have these options on their menu. A user must keep track of their previous purchases, grouped by Transaction—a Transaction is the set of items purchased at Checkout time. Users can log in and out—they do not need to Checkout before logging out. However, only one user can be logged in at a time—the system must allow something like “change user”. If a User logs back in, their Shopping Cart holds the same contents as before they logged out. Recommended Items and Discounts Each item can store a list of “if you liked this” recommendations. If a User adds an Item to their Shopping Cart, then the system suggests other titles they may like. Only similar types of things are recommended—i.e., when a Book is added, other Books (not Software) are suggested. At the time when a list of Recommended titles is given, the user has the option to add one of the recommended titles to their Shopping Cart. If a user adds the title, then they receive a discount of 15% off that second title (the first one is still full price); the User can add multiple recommended titles for 15% off each of them. If a Member adds the recommended title, then they get 25% discount off all the recommendations added. Note: when a recommended title is added, its recommendations are also shown, and are discounted if purchased at that time. You are NOT required to handle the special case of updating discounts when a User removes recommendations from their Cart. However, there is a Bonus Mark for this. Sample menus The menu for a standard User (i.e., a Shopper) should include the following options: 1. Add item to shopping cart 2. View shopping cart 3. Remove item from shopping cart 4. Checkout 5. List all items 6. Print previous purchases 7. Logout (change user) 0. Quit The menu for an Administrator should include the following options: 1. List all items (this option can include purchase statistics for each title) 2. Add copies to item 3. Change price of item 4. Add new user 5. Logout (change user) 0. Quit * SAMPLE RUNS and TEST DATA will be posted to Blackboard * Program Development When implementing large programs, especially using object-oriented style, it is highly recommended that you build your program incrementally. This assignment proposes a specific incremental implementation process: this is designed to both help you think about building large programs, and to help ensure good progress! You are not strictly required to follow the structure below, but it will help you manage complexity. Part A (2 marks): Extend Assignment 1 Start by extending your Assignment 1 solution (a sample solution will be made available): 1. Rename your main class to TechStore if necessary; 2. Extend your Book class (if necessary) to contain all data and operations it needs for Assignment 2, and appropriate classes for other types of Items to be sold; 3. Define Exceptions to handle problems/errors; in particular, you must handle invalid menu options or inputs. Part B (1 marks): Class Design Define all the classes and any interfaces needed for the described system. In particular, you should try to encapsulate all the appropriate data and operations that a class needs. This may mean some classes refer to each other (e.g., the way Account refers to Customer). At this point, you may just want to think about the data and operations and just write the definitions, not all the code. Part C (3 marks): Main Program Your main program should be in the TechStore class. (Of course, any class can contain a main(); this is useful for testing that class.) The main program will contain a menu that offers all the required options (these can be different for different Users!). The system will allow a User to login by typing their id and password and will check that these match: if it does not then the menu prints an error; if they do match, then the system prints a welcome message with the user’s name and shows them the appropriate menu. The system must keep a list of all its Users: this list must be efficient to look-up by User id.  Week 7 Demo (2 marks): You will be required to demonstrate your main program and design (with only bare functionality) by Week 7 at the latest. You must also submit to the associated WebLearn project by the Week 7 lecture. Part D (4 marks): Implement Core Functionality Implement the core functionality of the TechStore system described above, except for the recommendations, members, and discounts. You should be able to implement the rest of the TechStore functionality described above, and run and test your system. Part E (4 marks): Implement Recommendations , Members, Discounts Implement the functionality of providing recommendations, users becoming and being members, and discounts. Other (4 marks) As always, marks will be awarded for coding style, documentation/comments, code layout and clarity, meaningful error and other messages, proper error handling, choice of data structures and other design decisions. You are encouraged to discuss such issues with your tutors and lab assistants, or with the coding mentors. Bonus (2 marks) Note: There will be no hints or help offered on Bonus tasks.  1 bonus mark for early demonstration of Parts A,B,C in Week 6  1 bonus mark for correctly handling removal of recommended books from Cart—e.g., if a Member removes the first item then the 15/25% should be added back to the price of the recommended title, unless there are multiple recommendations linked to that title. Submission Instructions Full assignment submission will be via Weblearn, by 9AM, Tues April 28, 2015. You can submit your assignment as many times as you want before the due date. Each submission will overwrite any previous submissions. 1. You need to submit a class diagram (in pdf, gif or jpeg format). 2. You are required to submit your .java files weekly via Weblearn. Your progress will be taken into consideration if you need an extension. 3. There will be a separate WebLearn submission for Part A,B,C—you must submit to this before the Week 7 lecture to qualify for the 2 marks for Week 7 demo. 4. You must include a README file. This should describe how to run your program, what extra functionality you implemented, any standard functionality you know does not work, and any problems or assumptions. If the tutors have any problem running your program and the README does not help then you will lose marks. 5. For the code submission, you must include only the source files in your submission (do not submit any *.class files!). As always, your code must run on CSIT machines. 6. You must submit a single ZIP file—use zip/WinZIP to zip your files before submitting---do NOT submit rar or zipx files!! 7. If you use packages, it is your responsibility that these unpack properly into the correct folders and that your program compiles correctly.

sonali-developer,EmojiArt,"• App Description: A full fledged, ready to publish app on App Store, designed for iPad & iOS11 using Xcode & Swift 4. The app starts by displaying the Document Browser in its main screen like a local file system from where the user can choose the folder for this app on his/her device and upon selection the option for creation of a new untitled document become available for the first time whereas for other instances, existing documents created before by this app too gets displayed for editing. By selecting a blank document, another screen will be displayed that consists of a collection view of emoji’s on top along with an option to add more emoji’s in it by selecting from keyboard popped up with the textfield. Apart from this, file size, creation date and timing also appears in the bottom and in the Inspect tab on top right part of screen. From there, one can either return to document or can directly close it too. In the remaining area, there is a blank view for painting the Emoji Art. A user can either open up the Safari browser side by side and browse some image or select an emoji from Collection View, drag it by long pressing and drop it in the art view. In case of bad URL, warning gets displayed. The dropped image can be resized too. Other emoji’s can be dragged on top of the image and can be resized. Once done, a user can click on done button to exit from the document. Upon exit, the entire art view gets set as a thumbnail to this document’s file icon thereby making it easy to recognize the file in the folder. One can also save the document on cloud and can access it later from other iOS devices. • Implemented following special utilities in addition to core features: Drag and Drop Interaction, UITableView, UICollectionView, UITextField, UIScrollView& Multithreading, Codable, File Manager, URL, UIDocument,  UIDocumentBrowserVC, URLCache, UIImagePickerVC, Notification & KVO, Segues(Modal, Popover, Unwind & Embed), Alerts & ActionSheet, etc.",2018-05-29T20:45:48Z,2018-05-29 20:45:33,,3,0,50,1,0,0,0.0,1695,231,1926,

mnanda021,GUI-JDBC,"Part I (This is for your own exercise; there is no need to hand in the run results):  1. GUI  Create the GUI programs listed in Chapter 14 and 25 of the textbook using a Java IDE tool to generate the GUI code. You may use NetBeans or Eclipse as your IDE. These IDEs can be installed from textbook CD or download from Internet.  For each of the above java program, please add a Java utility class java.util.Calendar to display the date and time on the outputs.  Please generate the GUI code using an IDE such as Netbean or Eclipse, do not write the GUI code yourself.  2. JDBC  1. Create the database “books” from chapter 28 of the textbook in MySQL. The instructions and sql scripts can be found either from the lecture notes or textbook CD.  a. You can create your MySQL account in CS99 using the script at https://cs99.bradley.edu/~firewall/register.pl (You may need to use a version of IE or Firefox or Chrome that allows you to proceed and ignore the security warning, since CS99 HTTPS may still have some certificate issues at this time.)  b. Click the MySQL Book script link to download the SQL script to create the database. You can either create the books database use the phpMyAdmin or use the following commands:  $mysql –u username –p  >(type in password) … mysql> source mysqlbooks.sql; 2. Create and test the JDBC programs in chapter 28.   ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  Part II:  1. GUI  Design and develop a Book client GUI application program using NetBeans/Eclipse Java IDE tool to insert, update and delete Book data entries using stub functions (stub function is a place holder function that is empty except print out what it will do). Each group should have your unique GUI design.  Please generate the GUI code using an IDE, do not write the GUI code yourself.  The user interface window(s) should have as many of the following major GUI swing components (beans) as possible:  Basic Controls: JLabel, JTextfield/JPasswordField, JTextArea, JCheckBox, JButton, JRadioButton/ButtonGroup, JComboBox (Drop-down list), and JList/JScrollPane. Container components: JPanel, JTabbedPane, JDialog, JMenuBar, JMenu, JMenuItem, JCheckBoxMenuItem, and JRadioButtonMenuItem. (Extra Credit) Provide user with dynamically generated database tables and a data table (JTable) to insert, update and delete data entries. 2. JDBC  Develop a Java application program that implements the stub functions with sql statements against the MySQL Book database.  - Use connection string “jdbc:mysql://cs99.bradley.edu:3306/s_yourLoginName” for MySQL on cs99. 1.

sonali-developer,EmojiArtNewVersion,"• App Description: A full fledged, ready to publish app on App Store, designed for iPad & iOS11 using Xcode & Swift 4. The app starts by displaying the Document Browser in its main screen like a local file system from where the user can choose the folder for this app on his/her device and upon selection the option for creation of a new untitled document become available for the first time whereas for other instances, existing documents created before by this app too gets displayed for editing. By selecting a blank document, another screen will be displayed that consists of a collection view of emoji’s on top along with an option to add more emoji’s in it by selecting from keyboard popped up with the textfield. Apart from this, file size, creation date and timing also appears in the bottom and in the Inspect tab on top right part of screen. From there, one can either return to document or can directly close it too. In the remaining area, there is a blank view for painting the Emoji Art. A user can either open up the Safari browser side by side and browse some image or select an emoji from Collection View, drag it by long pressing and drop it in the art view. In case of bad URL, warning gets displayed. The dropped image can be resized too. Other emoji’s can be dragged on top of the image and can be resized. Once done, a user can click on done button to exit from the document. Upon exit, the entire art view gets set as a thumbnail to this document’s file icon thereby making it easy to recognize the file in the folder. One can also save the document on cloud and can access it later from other iOS devices. • Implemented following special utilities in addition to core features: Drag and Drop Interaction, UITableView, UICollectionView, UITextField, UIScrollView& Multithreading, Codable, File Manager, URL, UIDocument,  UIDocumentBrowserVC, URLCache, UIImagePickerVC, Notification & KVO, Segues(Modal, Popover, Unwind & Embed), Alerts & ActionSheet,etc.",2018-06-02T16:32:44Z,2018-06-02 14:27:11,,2,0,328,1,0,0,0.0,2214,336,2550,

elsiemalean,Facebook-Ericsson-XL-Axiata-to-Improve-Network-Performance,"Jakarta, Indonesia - Facebook, Ericsson and XL Axiata have developed a methodology that is expected to enhance and improve network performance of an application to as much as 70%.  As part of Internet.org’s mission to bring affordable internet access to two thirds of not only Indonesia’s but also of the entire world’s connection, Facebook and XL Axiata, in conjunction to the archipelago’s leading provider, XL Axiata, a subsidiary of Axis Capital Group based in Kuala Lumpur Malaysia but is servicing all over the world. The methodology will be used to measure and improve end to end network performance using simulated Facebook application use cases.  It has been reviewed that network-wide optimization implemented through the joint project delivered up to 70 percent improvement in app coverage.  In Indonesia, 75 percent of users are on 2G GSM/EDGE networks, yet the country has the fourth-largest Facebook user base in the world. The changing market realities in the country are reflected in XL Axiata's network, where, in 2013, data traffic rose by 142 percent. More than half of the operator's 62.9 million subscribers are data users and a majority of those use Facebook, according to XL Axiata estimates.  The joint project developed a framework for evaluating user key performance indicators (KPI) based on simulated Facebook application use cases using a test agent and correlated these KPIs with network statistics. Through this process, user-impacting issues were identified and addressed throughout the network. This move poses a warning to the two other leading network providers in Indonesia: Indosat and Telkomsel to step up their game.   The resultant optimizations improved app coverage by up to 70 percent: •	Number of connections completed within three seconds improved up to 70 percent •	Time to content improved up to 70 percent •	Upload time improved up to 50 percent  Recently the use of data services in Indonesia has increased significantly and is expected to continue into the future. We believe app coverage is essential and correlating Facebook application use cases with network-wide statistics has proven to be an innovative and efficient way to detect and address network optimization opportunities.  Facebook and Ericsson are among the founding members of internet.org. The companies have also announced the creation of a joint innovation lab supporting the Internet.org initiative. The Internet.org Innovation Lab, an Ericsson-Facebook collaboration, currently under development at Facebook's Menlo Park campus, will provide an environment and expertise for optimizing applications, networks, and services for the next five billion Internet users.

smmcgrath,MyFirstApp,"Built in Node.js open source server framework. In this project I moved from client-side development (using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS) to building a server-side web application using the Express.js web framework hosted in Node.js runtime environment. The site includes a flatty style landing page including navigatation bar, sign-up forms, staff info etc. It has an uncluttered and minimal UI. The backend API’s communicated with databases designed using MongoDB, an example of a NoSQL database program using JSON-like objects with schemas. All APIs, including GET, PUT, UPDATE and DELETE were tested using Postman. Great experience using PuTTY open-source terminal emulator, working remotely over SSH network protocol. Securing my API with authentication; hashing passwords using Bcrypt and issuing tokens with JSON Web Token (JWT). New additions help to restrict access and ensure tokens are verified. Previous to this the back-end APIs could be easily accessed via the URL. User comments coudl be retrieved, new ones saved, deleted or updated. Hashing is a means of transforming a string of characters (passwords, in my case) into a different and larger set of characters, thus protecting our sensitive data. Bcrypt is the password hashing function used.",2017-11-16T11:34:16Z,2017-11-16 11:34:16,,10,0,4019,1,342,342,11.4,11602,1624,13226,

The main purpose of this project will be to provide a customized solution to the university teachers to manage the resources and artifacts of a course that they are teaching in some specific semester. It will also help to bridge communication gap between teachers and students and between teacher and the program office.  The teachers and students will be able to log into the system only by using their email usernames and passwords. By using this system teachers will be able to mark attendance online, give assignments, upload lectures, notes, grades/marks etc. Students will be able to see the record of their attendance on their console, download lectures or notes, check their grades/marks etc. Feedbacks would be taken online; feedbacks will be displayed textually as well as graphically. It will also manage all the work of the coordinator office, it will keep record of everything including meetings, notifications and it will also manage the course file of the teachers.

TeamSazerac,TheGame,"This document describes the team work assignment for Telerik Academy students studying Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) – February 2014. Project Description Design and implement an object-oriented Role Playing Game by choice. Here are some suggestions: -	The world can be fantasy, sci-fi, modern, etc. -	You may have one or more heroes, gaining experience, having skills, wearing items, etc. -	You may have one or more players, fighting against a computer or against each other -	You may have enemies like creatures, machines, warriors, etc.  -	You may have items like swords, guns, armor, space-suits, etc. -	You may have skills like double-damage, teleportation, etc.  General Requirements Please define and implement the following object-oriented assets in your project: •	At least 5 interfaces (with one or more implementations) •	At least 15 classes (implementing the application logic) •	At least 3 abstract class (with inheritors) •	At least 1 exception class (with usage in your code) •	At least 3 levels of depth in inheritance •	At least 1 polymorphism usage •	At least 1 structure •	At least 1 enumeration •	At least 1 event (with subscribers) •	At least 1 design pattern (e.g. Composite, Singleton, Factory, Wrapper, Bridge, Command, Iterator, …) You might read about design patterns in Wikipedia, Sourcemaking, DoFactory and others. Additional Requirements •	Follow the best practices for OO design: use data encapsulation, use exception handling properly, use delegates and events like it is recommended in MSDN, use inheritance, abstraction and polymorphism properly, follow the principles of strong cohesion and loose coupling. •	Obligatory use Git to keep your source code and for team collaboration (you might use https://github.com/). TFS or SVN are not allowed. Use Git. •	Provide a class diagram (to visualize all types). Optional Requirements If you have a chance, time and a suitable situation, you might add some of the following to your project: •	Static members (fields, properties, constructor, etc.) •	Constants, generic types, indexers, operators •	Lambda expressions and LINQ •	Implementation of IEnumerable<T>, ICloneable, ToString() override •	Namespaces (if your classes are too much)  •	User interface (UI) – console, graphical, web or mobile Non-Required Work •	Completely finished project is not obligatory required. It will not be a big problem if your project is not completely finished or is not working greatly. This team work project is for educational purpose. Its main purpose it to experience object-oriented modeling and OOP in a real-world project and to get some experience in team working and team collaboration with Git.  Deliverables Put the following in a ZIP archive and submit it (each team member submits the same file): •	The complete source code. •	Brief documentation of your project (2-3 pages). It should provide the following information (in brief): o	Team name and list of team members o	Project purpose – what problem do you solve? o	Class diagram of your types o	The URL of your Git repository o	Any other information (optionally) •	Optionally provide a PowerPoint presentation designed for the project defense. Public Project Defense Each team will have to deliver a public defense of its work in from of the other students and trainers. You will have only 10 minutes for the following: •	Demonstrate the application (very shortly). •	Show the class diagram (just a glance). •	Show the source code in the Git web-based source code browser. •	Show the commits logs to confirm those team members who have contributed. •	Optionally you might prepare a PowerPoint presentation (3-4 slides). Please be strict in timing! Be well prepared for presenting maximum of your work for minimum time. Bring your own laptop. Test it preliminary with the multimedia projector. Open the project assets beforehand to save time. You have 10 minutes, no more. Give Feedback about Your Teammates You will be invited to provide feedback about all your teammates, their attitude to this project, their technical skills, their team working skills, their contribution to the project, etc. The feedback is important part of the project evaluation so take it seriously and be honest.",2014-02-16T16:53:38Z,2014-02-16 16:53:39,,28,0,229,2,0,0,0.0,1112,251,1363,

PhoenixWebGroupJay,Google-Diff-Match-Patch--C--,"The Diff Match and Patch libraries offer robust algorithms to perform the operations required for synchronizing plain text.  Diff: Compare two blocks of plain text and efficiently return a list of differences.  Match: Given a search string, find its best fuzzy match in a block of plain text. Weighted for both accuracy and location.  Patch: Apply a list of patches onto plain text. Use best-effort to apply patch even when the underlying text doesn't match.  Currently available in Java, JavaScript, Dart, C++, C#, Objective C, Lua and Python. Regardless of language, each library features the same API and the same functionality. All versions also have comprehensive test harnesses. Algorithms: This library implements Myer's diff algorithm which is generally considered to be the best general-purpose diff. A layer of pre-diff speedups and post-diff cleanups surround the diff algorithm, improving both performance and output quality.  This library also implements a Bitap matching algorithm at the heart of a flexible matching and patching strategy.

amanzanom,primeScaff,"primeScaff is intended to automate the sometimes tedious process of manually designing specific primer pairs around gaps of genomic scaffolds and speedup the genome finishing stage of a genome sequencing project. It incorporates de-novo repeat finding using RECON to avoid as much as possible designing primers in repetitive regions and offers the possibility to easily fine-tune the primer design options using primer3. It outputs the repeat, gap and primer annotations in gff2 and gff3 to easily load and visualize the results using tools like UGENE (http://ugene.unipro.ru/) (recommended) or artemis (http://www.sanger.ac.uk/resources/software/artemis/).",2013-08-26T12:32:47Z,2013-08-26 12:32:47,2019-01-06 20:47:58,3,0,13468,1,1959,1959,65.3,297072,0,297072,1959.0

biswapriya,Updates-in-Metabolomics-Tools-and-Resources-2014-2015,"Data processing and interpretation represent the most challenging and time-consuming steps in high-throughput metabolomic experiments, regardless of the analytical platform (mass spectrometry [MS] or nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy [NMR]-based) used for data acquisition. Improved machinery in metabolomics generate increasingly complex data sets which create the need for more and better processing and analysis software and in-silico approaches to understand the resulting data. However, a comprehensive source of information describing the utility of the most recently developed and released metabolomics resources – in the form of tools, software, and databases - is currently lacking. Thus, here we provide an overview of freely-available, open-source, tools, algorithms and frameworks to make both upcoming and established metabolomics researchers aware of the recent developments in an attempt to advance and facilitate data processing workflows in their metabolomics research. The major topics include tools and researches for data processing, data annotation, and data visualization in MS and NMR based metabolomics. Most in this review described tools are dedicated to untargeted metabolomics workflows; however, some more specialist tools are described as well. All tools and resources described including their analytical and computational platform dependencies are summarized in an overview Table.",2015-11-05T02:58:14Z,,,1,0,120,1,0,0,0.0,2,0,2,

LuaJava also allows Java to implement an interface using Lua. This way any interface can be implemented in Lua and passed as parameter to any method, and when called, the equivalent function will be called in Lua, and it's result passed back to Java.",2010-04-09T19:47:49Z,2004-08-26 14:22:15,,160,0,557,9,5365,48285,1609.5,20005,8797,28802,

PhongPham101190,Red-C-SDK,"MEGA SDK - Client Access Engine Coverity Scan Build Status MEGA --- The Privacy Company --- is a Secure Cloud Storage provider that protects your data thanks to end-to-end encryption. We call it User Controlled Encryption, or UCE, and all our clients automatically manage it.  All files stored on MEGA are encrypted. All data transfers from and to MEGA are encrypted. And while most cloud storage providers can and do claim the same, MEGA is different – unlike the industry norm where the cloud storage provider holds the decryption key, with MEGA, you control the encryption, you hold the keys, and you decide who you grant or deny access to your files.  This SDK brings you all the power of our client applications and let you create your own or analyze the security of our products. Are you ready to start? Please continue reading.  SDK Contents  In this SDK, you can find our low level SDK, that was already released few months after the MEGA launch, a new intermediate layer to make it easier to use and to bind with other programming languages, and example apps for all our currently supported platforms (Windows, Linux, OSX, Android, iOS and Windows Phone).  In the examples folder you can find example apps using:  The low level SDK:  megacli (a powerful command line tool that allows to use all SDK features) megasimplesync (a command line tool that allows to use the synchronization engine) The intermediate layer:  An example app for Visual Studio in examples/win32 An example app for Android (using Java bindings based on SWIG) in examples/android An example app for iOS (using Objective-C bindings) in examples/iOS An example app for Windows Phone (using Windows Phone bindings) in examples/wp8 Building  If you plan to develop an app using this SDK, please use the stable branch or the last released tarball. The master branch is continuously evolving, could be unstable and could change very often.  For platforms with Autotools, the generic way to build and install it is:  sh autogen.sh ./configure make sudo make install That compilation will include the examples using our low level SDK (megacli and megasimplesync) You also have specific build instructions for OSX (doc/OSX.txt) and FreeBSD (doc/FreeBSD.txt) and a build script to automatically download and build the SDK along with all its dependencies (contrib/build_sdk.sh)  For other platforms, or if you want to see how to use the new intermediate layer, the easiest way is to get a smooth start is to build one of the examples in subfolders of the examples folder.  All these folders contains a README.md file with information about how to get the project up and running, including the installation of all required dependencies.  Usage  The low level SDK doesn't have inline documentation yet. If you want to use it, please check one of our example apps (examples/megacli, examples/megasimplesync).  The new intermediate layer has been documented using Doxygen. The only public header that you need to include to use is include/megaapi.h. You can read the documentation in that header file, or download the same documentation in HTML format from this link:  https://mega.co.nz/#!c5FzhBJL!HUVjsOJTylwkmXPZ0AxT66Wuu4YvZInyHbWGYgvTHt4  Additional info  Platform Dependencies  Dependencies are different for each platform because the SDK uses generic interfaces to get some features and they have different implentations:  Network (cURL with OpenSSL/c-ares or WinHTTP) Filesystem access (Posix or Win32) Graphics management (FreeImage, QT or iOS frameworks) Database (SQLite or Berkeley DB) Threads/mutexes (Win32, pthread, QT threads, or C++11) POSIX (Linux/Darwin/BSD/OSX ...)  Install the following development packages, if available, or download and compile their respective sources (package names are for Debian and RedHat derivatives, respectively):  cURL (libcurl4-openssl-dev, libcurl-devel), compiled with --enable-ssl c-ares (libc-ares-dev, libcares-devel, c-ares-devel) OpenSSL (libssl-dev, openssl-devel) Crypto++ (libcrypto++-dev, libcryptopp-devel) zlib (zlib1g-dev, zlib-devel) SQLite (libsqlite3-dev, sqlite-devel) or configure --without-sqlite FreeImage (libfreeimage-dev, freeimage-devel) or configure --without-freeimage pthread Optional dependency:  Sodium (libsodium-dev, libsodium-devel), configure --with-sodium Filesystem event monitoring: The provided filesystem layer implements the Linux inotify and the MacOS fsevents interfaces.  To build the reference megacli example, you may also need to install:  GNU Readline (libreadline-dev, readline-devel) For Android, we provide an additional implementation of the graphics subsystem using Android libraries.  For iOS, we provide an additional implementation of the graphics subsystem using Objective C frameworks.  Windows  To build the client access engine under Windows, you'll need the following:  A Windows-native C++ development environment (e.g. MinGW or Visual Studio) Crypto++ zlib (until WinHTTP learns how to deal with Content-Encoding: gzip) SQLite or configure --without-sqlite FreeImage or configure --without-freeimage pthreads (MinGW) Optional dependency:  Sodium or configure --with-sodium To build the reference megacli.exe example, you will also need to procure development packages (at least headers and .lib/.a libraries) of:  GNU Readline/Termcap Folder syncing  In this version, the sync functionality is limited in scope and functionality:  There is no locking between clients accessing the same remote folder. Concurrent creation of identically named files and folders can result in server-side dupes.  Syncing between clients with differing filesystem naming semantics can lead to loss of data, e.g. when syncing a folder containing ABC.TXT and abc.txt with a Windows client.  On POSIX platforms, filenames are assumed to be encoded in UTF-8. Invalid byte sequences can lead to undefined behaviour.  Local filesystem items must not be exposed to the sync subsystem more than once. Any dupes, whether by nesting syncs or through filesystem links, will lead to unexpected results and loss of data.  No in-place versioning. Deleted remote files can be found in //bin/SyncDebris (only when syncing to the logged in account's own cloud drive - there is no SyncDebris facility on syncs to inbound shares), deleted local files in a sync-specific hidden debris folder located in the local sync's root folder.  No delta writes. Changed files are always overwritten as a whole, which means that it is not a good idea to sync e.g. live database tables.  No direct peer-to-peer syncing. Even two machines in the same local subnet will still sync via the remote storage infrastructure.  No support for unidirectional syncing (backup-only, restore-only). Syncing to an inbound share requires it to have full access rights.  megacli on Windows  The megacli example is currently not handling console Unicode input/output correctly if run in cmd.exe.  Filename caveats: Please prefix all paths with \\?\ to avoid the following issues:  The MAX_PATH (260 character) length limitation, which would make it impossible to access files in deep directory structures  Prohibited filenames (con/prn/aux/clock$/nul/com1...com9/lpt1...lpt9). Such files and folders will still be inaccessible through e.g. Explorer!  Also, disable automatic short name generation to eliminate the risk of clashes with existing short names.",2015-12-12T21:20:13Z,,,1,0,19,1,0,0,0.0,30,0,30,

N30nHaCkZ,linux,"  Linux kernel release 3.x <http://kernel.org/>  These are the release notes for Linux version 3.  Read them carefully, as they tell you what this is all about, explain how to install the kernel, and what to do if something goes wrong.   WHAT IS LINUX?    Linux is a clone of the operating system Unix, written from scratch by   Linus Torvalds with assistance from a loosely-knit team of hackers across   the Net. It aims towards POSIX and Single UNIX Specification compliance.    It has all the features you would expect in a modern fully-fledged Unix,   including true multitasking, virtual memory, shared libraries, demand   loading, shared copy-on-write executables, proper memory management,   and multistack networking including IPv4 and IPv6.    It is distributed under the GNU General Public License - see the   accompanying COPYING file for more details.   ON WHAT HARDWARE DOES IT RUN?    Although originally developed first for 32-bit x86-based PCs (386 or higher),   today Linux also runs on (at least) the Compaq Alpha AXP, Sun SPARC and   UltraSPARC, Motorola 68000, PowerPC, PowerPC64, ARM, Hitachi SuperH, Cell,   IBM S/390, MIPS, HP PA-RISC, Intel IA-64, DEC VAX, AMD x86-64, AXIS CRIS,   Xtensa, Tilera TILE, AVR32 and Renesas M32R architectures.    Linux is easily portable to most general-purpose 32- or 64-bit architectures   as long as they have a paged memory management unit (PMMU) and a port of the   GNU C compiler (gcc) (part of The GNU Compiler Collection, GCC). Linux has   also been ported to a number of architectures without a PMMU, although   functionality is then obviously somewhat limited.   Linux has also been ported to itself. You can now run the kernel as a   userspace application - this is called UserMode Linux (UML).  DOCUMENTATION:   - There is a lot of documentation available both in electronic form on    the Internet and in books, both Linux-specific and pertaining to    general UNIX questions.  I'd recommend looking into the documentation    subdirectories on any Linux FTP site for the LDP (Linux Documentation    Project) books.  This README is not meant to be documentation on the    system: there are much better sources available.   - There are various README files in the Documentation/ subdirectory:    these typically contain kernel-specific installation notes for some     drivers for example. See Documentation/00-INDEX for a list of what    is contained in each file.  Please read the Changes file, as it    contains information about the problems, which may result by upgrading    your kernel.   - The Documentation/DocBook/ subdirectory contains several guides for    kernel developers and users.  These guides can be rendered in a    number of formats:  PostScript (.ps), PDF, HTML, & man-pages, among others.    After installation, ""make psdocs"", ""make pdfdocs"", ""make htmldocs"",    or ""make mandocs"" will render the documentation in the requested format.  INSTALLING the kernel source:   - If you install the full sources, put the kernel tarball in a    directory where you have permissions (eg. your home directory) and    unpack it:       gzip -cd linux-3.X.tar.gz | tar xvf -     or       bzip2 -dc linux-3.X.tar.bz2 | tar xvf -     Replace ""X"" with the version number of the latest kernel.     Do NOT use the /usr/src/linux area! This area has a (usually    incomplete) set of kernel headers that are used by the library header    files.  They should match the library, and not get messed up by    whatever the kernel-du-jour happens to be.   - You can also upgrade between 3.x releases by patching.  Patches are    distributed in the traditional gzip and the newer bzip2 format.  To    install by patching, get all the newer patch files, enter the    top level directory of the kernel source (linux-3.X) and execute:       gzip -cd ../patch-3.x.gz | patch -p1     or       bzip2 -dc ../patch-3.x.bz2 | patch -p1     Replace ""x"" for all versions bigger than the version ""X"" of your current    source tree, _in_order_, and you should be ok.  You may want to remove    the backup files (some-file-name~ or some-file-name.orig), and make sure    that there are no failed patches (some-file-name# or some-file-name.rej).    If there are, either you or I have made a mistake.     Unlike patches for the 3.x kernels, patches for the 3.x.y kernels    (also known as the -stable kernels) are not incremental but instead apply    directly to the base 3.x kernel.  For example, if your base kernel is 3.0    and you want to apply the 3.0.3 patch, you must not first apply the 3.0.1    and 3.0.2 patches. Similarly, if you are running kernel version 3.0.2 and    want to jump to 3.0.3, you must first reverse the 3.0.2 patch (that is,    patch -R) _before_ applying the 3.0.3 patch. You can read more on this in    Documentation/applying-patches.txt     Alternatively, the script patch-kernel can be used to automate this    process.  It determines the current kernel version and applies any    patches found.       linux/scripts/patch-kernel linux     The first argument in the command above is the location of the    kernel source.  Patches are applied from the current directory, but    an alternative directory can be specified as the second argument.   - Make sure you have no stale .o files and dependencies lying around:       cd linux      make mrproper     You should now have the sources correctly installed.  SOFTWARE REQUIREMENTS     Compiling and running the 3.x kernels requires up-to-date    versions of various software packages.  Consult    Documentation/Changes for the minimum version numbers required    and how to get updates for these packages.  Beware that using    excessively old versions of these packages can cause indirect    errors that are very difficult to track down, so don't assume that    you can just update packages when obvious problems arise during    build or operation.  BUILD directory for the kernel:     When compiling the kernel, all output files will per default be    stored together with the kernel source code.    Using the option ""make O=output/dir"" allow you to specify an alternate    place for the output files (including .config).    Example:       kernel source code: /usr/src/linux-3.X      build directory:    /home/name/build/kernel     To configure and build the kernel, use:       cd /usr/src/linux-3.X      make O=/home/name/build/kernel menuconfig      make O=/home/name/build/kernel      sudo make O=/home/name/build/kernel modules_install install     Please note: If the 'O=output/dir' option is used, then it must be    used for all invocations of make.  CONFIGURING the kernel:     Do not skip this step even if you are only upgrading one minor    version.  New configuration options are added in each release, and    odd problems will turn up if the configuration files are not set up    as expected.  If you want to carry your existing configuration to a    new version with minimal work, use ""make oldconfig"", which will    only ask you for the answers to new questions.   - Alternative configuration commands are:       ""make config""      Plain text interface.       ""make menuconfig""  Text based color menus, radiolists & dialogs.       ""make nconfig""     Enhanced text based color menus.       ""make xconfig""     X windows (Qt) based configuration tool.       ""make gconfig""     X windows (Gtk) based configuration tool.       ""make oldconfig""   Default all questions based on the contents of                         your existing ./.config file and asking about                         new config symbols.       ""make silentoldconfig""                         Like above, but avoids cluttering the screen                         with questions already answered.                         Additionally updates the dependencies.       ""make olddefconfig""                         Like above, but sets new symbols to their default                         values without prompting.       ""make defconfig""   Create a ./.config file by using the default                         symbol values from either arch/$ARCH/defconfig                         or arch/$ARCH/configs/${PLATFORM}_defconfig,                         depending on the architecture.       ""make ${PLATFORM}_defconfig""                         Create a ./.config file by using the default                         symbol values from                         arch/$ARCH/configs/${PLATFORM}_defconfig.                         Use ""make help"" to get a list of all available                         platforms of your architecture.       ""make allyesconfig""                         Create a ./.config file by setting symbol                         values to 'y' as much as possible.       ""make allmodconfig""                         Create a ./.config file by setting symbol                         values to 'm' as much as possible.       ""make allnoconfig"" Create a ./.config file by setting symbol                         values to 'n' as much as possible.       ""make randconfig""  Create a ./.config file by setting symbol                         values to random values.       ""make localmodconfig"" Create a config based on current config and                            loaded modules (lsmod). Disables any module                            option that is not needed for the loaded modules.                             To create a localmodconfig for another machine,                            store the lsmod of that machine into a file                            and pass it in as a LSMOD parameter.                     target$ lsmod > /tmp/mylsmod                    target$ scp /tmp/mylsmod host:/tmp                     host$ make LSMOD=/tmp/mylsmod localmodconfig                             The above also works when cross compiling.       ""make localyesconfig"" Similar to localmodconfig, except it will convert                            all module options to built in (=y) options.     You can find more information on using the Linux kernel config tools    in Documentation/kbuild/kconfig.txt.   - NOTES on ""make config"":      - Having unnecessary drivers will make the kernel bigger, and can       under some circumstances lead to problems: probing for a       nonexistent controller card may confuse your other controllers      - Compiling the kernel with ""Processor type"" set higher than 386       will result in a kernel that does NOT work on a 386.  The       kernel will detect this on bootup, and give up.      - A kernel with math-emulation compiled in will still use the       coprocessor if one is present: the math emulation will just       never get used in that case.  The kernel will be slightly larger,       but will work on different machines regardless of whether they       have a math coprocessor or not.      - The ""kernel hacking"" configuration details usually result in a       bigger or slower kernel (or both), and can even make the kernel       less stable by configuring some routines to actively try to       break bad code to find kernel problems (kmalloc()).  Thus you       should probably answer 'n' to the questions for ""development"",       ""experimental"", or ""debugging"" features.  COMPILING the kernel:   - Make sure you have at least gcc 3.2 available.    For more information, refer to Documentation/Changes.     Please note that you can still run a.out user programs with this kernel.   - Do a ""make"" to create a compressed kernel image. It is also    possible to do ""make install"" if you have lilo installed to suit the    kernel makefiles, but you may want to check your particular lilo setup first.     To do the actual install, you have to be root, but none of the normal    build should require that. Don't take the name of root in vain.   - If you configured any of the parts of the kernel as `modules', you    will also have to do ""make modules_install"".   - Verbose kernel compile/build output:     Normally, the kernel build system runs in a fairly quiet mode (but not    totally silent).  However, sometimes you or other kernel developers need    to see compile, link, or other commands exactly as they are executed.    For this, use ""verbose"" build mode.  This is done by inserting    ""V=1"" in the ""make"" command.  E.g.:       make V=1 all     To have the build system also tell the reason for the rebuild of each    target, use ""V=2"".  The default is ""V=0"".   - Keep a backup kernel handy in case something goes wrong.  This is     especially true for the development releases, since each new release    contains new code which has not been debugged.  Make sure you keep a    backup of the modules corresponding to that kernel, as well.  If you    are installing a new kernel with the same version number as your    working kernel, make a backup of your modules directory before you    do a ""make modules_install"".     Alternatively, before compiling, use the kernel config option    ""LOCALVERSION"" to append a unique suffix to the regular kernel version.    LOCALVERSION can be set in the ""General Setup"" menu.   - In order to boot your new kernel, you'll need to copy the kernel    image (e.g. .../linux/arch/i386/boot/bzImage after compilation)    to the place where your regular bootable kernel is found.    - Booting a kernel directly from a floppy without the assistance of a    bootloader such as LILO, is no longer supported.     If you boot Linux from the hard drive, chances are you use LILO, which    uses the kernel image as specified in the file /etc/lilo.conf.  The    kernel image file is usually /vmlinuz, /boot/vmlinuz, /bzImage or    /boot/bzImage.  To use the new kernel, save a copy of the old image    and copy the new image over the old one.  Then, you MUST RERUN LILO    to update the loading map!! If you don't, you won't be able to boot    the new kernel image.     Reinstalling LILO is usually a matter of running /sbin/lilo.     You may wish to edit /etc/lilo.conf to specify an entry for your    old kernel image (say, /vmlinux.old) in case the new one does not    work.  See the LILO docs for more information.      After reinstalling LILO, you should be all set.  Shutdown the system,    reboot, and enjoy!     If you ever need to change the default root device, video mode,    ramdisk size, etc.  in the kernel image, use the 'rdev' program (or    alternatively the LILO boot options when appropriate).  No need to    recompile the kernel to change these parameters.    - Reboot with the new kernel and enjoy.   IF SOMETHING GOES WRONG:   - If you have problems that seem to be due to kernel bugs, please check    the file MAINTAINERS to see if there is a particular person associated    with the part of the kernel that you are having trouble with. If there    isn't anyone listed there, then the second best thing is to mail    them to me (torvalds@linux-foundation.org), and possibly to any other    relevant mailing-list or to the newsgroup.   - In all bug-reports, *please* tell what kernel you are talking about,    how to duplicate the problem, and what your setup is (use your common    sense).  If the problem is new, tell me so, and if the problem is    old, please try to tell me when you first noticed it.   - If the bug results in a message like       unable to handle kernel paging request at address C0000010      Oops: 0002      EIP:   0010:XXXXXXXX      eax: xxxxxxxx   ebx: xxxxxxxx   ecx: xxxxxxxx   edx: xxxxxxxx      esi: xxxxxxxx   edi: xxxxxxxx   ebp: xxxxxxxx      ds: xxxx  es: xxxx  fs: xxxx  gs: xxxx      Pid: xx, process nr: xx      xx xx xx xx xx xx xx xx xx xx     or similar kernel debugging information on your screen or in your    system log, please duplicate it *exactly*.  The dump may look    incomprehensible to you, but it does contain information that may    help debugging the problem.  The text above the dump is also    important: it tells something about why the kernel dumped code (in    the above example, it's due to a bad kernel pointer). More information    on making sense of the dump is in Documentation/oops-tracing.txt   - If you compiled the kernel with CONFIG_KALLSYMS you can send the dump    as is, otherwise you will have to use the ""ksymoops"" program to make    sense of the dump (but compiling with CONFIG_KALLSYMS is usually preferred).    This utility can be downloaded from    ftp://ftp.<country>.kernel.org/pub/linux/utils/kernel/ksymoops/ .    Alternatively, you can do the dump lookup by hand:   - In debugging dumps like the above, it helps enormously if you can    look up what the EIP value means.  The hex value as such doesn't help    me or anybody else very much: it will depend on your particular    kernel setup.  What you should do is take the hex value from the EIP    line (ignore the ""0010:""), and look it up in the kernel namelist to    see which kernel function contains the offending address.     To find out the kernel function name, you'll need to find the system    binary associated with the kernel that exhibited the symptom.  This is    the file 'linux/vmlinux'.  To extract the namelist and match it against    the EIP from the kernel crash, do:       nm vmlinux | sort | less     This will give you a list of kernel addresses sorted in ascending    order, from which it is simple to find the function that contains the    offending address.  Note that the address given by the kernel    debugging messages will not necessarily match exactly with the    function addresses (in fact, that is very unlikely), so you can't    just 'grep' the list: the list will, however, give you the starting    point of each kernel function, so by looking for the function that    has a starting address lower than the one you are searching for but    is followed by a function with a higher address you will find the one    you want.  In fact, it may be a good idea to include a bit of    ""context"" in your problem report, giving a few lines around the    interesting one.      If you for some reason cannot do the above (you have a pre-compiled    kernel image or similar), telling me as much about your setup as    possible will help.  Please read the REPORTING-BUGS document for details.   - Alternatively, you can use gdb on a running kernel. (read-only; i.e. you    cannot change values or set break points.) To do this, first compile the    kernel with -g; edit arch/i386/Makefile appropriately, then do a ""make    clean"". You'll also need to enable CONFIG_PROC_FS (via ""make config"").     After you've rebooted with the new kernel, do ""gdb vmlinux /proc/kcore"".    You can now use all the usual gdb commands. The command to look up the    point where your system crashed is ""l *0xXXXXXXXX"". (Replace the XXXes    with the EIP value.)     gdb'ing a non-running kernel currently fails because gdb (wrongly)    disregards the starting offset for which the kernel is compiled.",2015-03-16T12:58:31Z,,,1,0,0,1,0,0,0.0,2,0,2,

It also provides persistent object relationships (one to many, many to many, one to one).",2010-10-27T14:23:52Z,2007-10-22 15:11:43,,83,0,1042,2,1181,2362,78.73,17687,11449,29136,

SOYJUN,FTP-implement-based-on-UDP,"The aim of this assignment is to have you do UDP socket client / server programming with a focus on two broad aspects :  Setting up the exchange between the client and server in a secure way despite the lack of a formal connection (as in TCP) between the two, so that ‘outsider’ UDP datagrams (broadcast, multicast, unicast - fortuitously or maliciously) cannot intrude on the communication.  Introducing application-layer protocol data-transmission reliability, flow control and congestion control in the client and server using TCP-like ARQ sliding window mechanisms. The second item above is much more of a challenge to implement than the first, though neither is particularly trivial. But they are not tightly interdependent; each can be worked on separately at first and then integrated together at a later stage.  Apart from the material in Chapters 8, 14 & 22 (especially Sections 22.5 - 22.7), and the experience you gained from the preceding assignment, you will also need to refer to the following :  ioctl function (Chapter 17).  get_ifi_info function (Section 17.6, Chapter 17). This function will be used by the server code to discover its node’s network interfaces so that it can bind all its interface IP addresses (see Section 22.6).  ‘Race’ conditions (Section 20.5, Chapter 20) You also need a thorough understanding of how the TCP protocol implements reliable data transfer, flow control and congestion control. Chapters 17- 24 of   TCP/IP Illustrated, Volume 1  by W. Richard Stevens gives a good overview of TCP. Though somewhat dated for some things (it was published in 1994), it remains, overall, a good basic reference.  Overview  This assignment asks you to implement a primitive file transfer protocol for Unix platforms, based on UDP, and with TCP-like reliability added to the transfer operation using timeouts and sliding-window mechanisms, and implementing flow and congestion control. The server is a concurrent server which can handle multiple clients simultaneously. A client gives the server the name of a file. The server forks off a child which reads directly from the file and transfers the contents over to the client using UDP datagrams. The client prints out the file contents as they come in, in order, with nothing missing and with no duplication of content, directly on to stdout (via the receiver sliding window, of course, but with no other intermediate buffering). The file to be transferred can be of arbitrary length, but its contents are always straightforward ascii text.  As an aside let me mention that assuming the file contents ascii is not as restrictive as it sounds. We can always pretend, for example, that binary files are base64 encoded (“ASCII armor”). A real file transfer protocol would, of course, have to worry about transferring files between heterogeneous platforms with different file structure conventions and semantics. The sender would first have to transform the file into a platform-independent, protocol-defined, format (using, say, ASN.1, or some such standard), and the receiver would have to transform the received file into its platform’s native file format. This kind of thing can be fairly time consuming, and is certainly very tedious, to implement, with little educational value - it is not part of this assignment.  Arguments for the server  You should provide the server with an input file server.in from which it reads the following information, in the order shown, one item per line :  Well-known port number for server. Maximum sending sliding-window size (in datagram units). You will not be handing in your server.in file. We shall create our own when we come to test your code. So it is important that you stick strictly to the file name and content conventions specified above. The same applies to the client.in input file below.  Arguments for the client  The client is to be provided with an input file client.in from which it reads the following information, in the order shown, one item per line :  IP address of server (not the hostname). Well-known port number of server. filename to be transferred. Receiving sliding-window size (in datagram units). Random generator seed value. Probability p of datagram loss. This should be a real number in the range [ 0.0 , 1.0 ]  (value 0.0 means no loss occurs; value 1.0 means all datagrams all lost). The mean µ, in milliseconds, for an exponential distribution controlling the rate at which the client reads received datagram payloads from its receive buffer. Operation  Server starts up and reads its arguments from file server.in.  As we shall see, when a client communicates with the server, the server will want to know what IP address that client is using to identify the server (i.e. , the destination IP address in the incoming datagram). Normally, this can be done relatively straightforwardly using the IP_RECVDESTADDR socket option, and picking up the information using the ancillary data (‘control information’) capability of the recvmsg function. Unfortunately, Solaris 2.10 does not support the IP_RECVDESTADDR option (nor, incidentally, does it support the msg_flags option in msghdr - see p.390). This considerably complicates things.  In the absence of IP_RECVDESTADDR, what the server has to do as part of its initialization phase is to bind each IP address it has (and, simultaneously, its well-known port number, which it has read in from server.in) to a separate UDP socket. The code in Section 22.6, which uses the get_ifi_info function, shows you how to do that. However, there are important differences between that code and the version you want to implement. The code of Section 22.6 binds the IP addresses and forks off a child for each address that is bound to. We do not want to do that. Instead you should have an array of socket descriptors. For each IP address, create a new socket and bind the address (and well-known port number) to the socket without forking off child processes. Creating child processes comes later, when clients arrive.  The code of Section 22.6 also attempts to bind broadcast addresses. We do not want to do this. It binds a wildcard IP address, which we certainly do not want to do either. We should bind strictly only unicast addresses (including the loopback address).  The get_ifi_info function (which the code in Section 22.6 uses) has to be modified so that it also gets the network masks for the IP addresses of the node, and adds these to the information stored in the linked list of ifi_info structures (see Figure 17.5, p.471) it produces. As you go binding each IP address to a distinct socket, it will be useful for later processing to build your own array of structures, where a structure element records the following information for each socket :  sockfd IP address bound to the socket network mask for the IP address subnet address (obtained by doing a bit-wise and between the IP address and its network mask)  Report, in a ReadMe file which you hand in with your code, on the modifications you had to introduce to ensure that only unicast addresses are bound, and on your implementation of the array of structures described above.  You should print out on stdout, with an appropriate message and appropriately formatted in dotted decimal notation, the IP address, network mask, and subnet address for each socket in your array of structures (you do not need to print the sockfd).  The server now uses select to monitor the sockets it has created for incoming datagrams. When it returns from select, it must use recvfrom or recvmsg to read the incoming datagram (see 6. below).  When a client starts, it first reads its arguments from the file client.in.  The client checks if the server host is ‘local’ to its (extended) Ethernet. If so, all its communication to the server is to occur as MSG_DONTROUTE (or SO_DONTROUTE socket option). It determines if the server host is ‘local’ as follows. The first thing the client should do is to use the modified get_ifi_info function to obtain all of its IP addresses and associated network masks.  Print out on stdout, in dotted decimal notation and with an appropriate message, the IP addresses and network masks obtained.  In the following, IPserver designates the IP address the client will use to identify the server, and IPclient designates the IP address the client will choose to identify itself.  The client checks whether the server is on the same host. If so, it should use the loopback address 127.0.0.1 for the server (i.e. , IPserver = 127.0.0.1). IPclient should also be set to the loopback address.  Otherwise it proceeds as follows:  IPserver is set to the IP address for the server in the client.in file. Given IPserver and the (unicast) IP addresses and network masks for the client returned by get_ifi_info in the linked list of ifi_info structures, you should be able to figure out if the server node is ‘local’ or not. This will be discussed in class; but let me just remind you here that you should use ‘longest prefix matching’ where applicable.  If there are multiple client addresses, and the server host is ‘local’, the client chooses an IP address for itself, IPclient, which matches up as ‘local’ according to your examination above. If the server host is not ‘local’, then IPclient can be chosen arbitrarily.  Print out on stdout the results of your examination, as to whether the server host is ‘local’ or not, as well as the IPclient and IPserver addresses selected.  Note that this manner of determining whether the server is local or not is somewhat clumsy and ‘over-engineered’, and, as such, should be viewed more in the nature of a pedagogical exercise. Ideally, we would like to look up the server IP address(es) in the routing table (see Section 18.3). This requires that a routing socket be created, for which we need superuser privilege. Alternatively, we might want to dump out the routing table, using the sysctl function for example (see Section 18.4), and examine it directly. Unfortunately, Solaris 2.10 does not support sysctl.   Furthermore, note that there is a slight problem with the address 130.245.1.123/24 assigned to compserv3 (see rightmost column of file hosts, and note that this particular compserv3 address “overlaps” with the 130.245.1.x/28 addresses in that same column assigned to compserv1, compserv2 & comserv4). In particular, if the client is running on compserv3 and the server on any of the other three compservs, and if that server node is also being identified to the client by its /28 (rather than its /24) address, then the client will get a “false positive” when it tests as to whether the server node is local or not. In other words, the client will deem the server node to be local, whereas in fact it should not be considered local. Because of this, it is perhaps best simply not to use compserv3 to run the client (but it is o.k. to use it to run the server).   Finally, using MSG_DONTROUTE where possible would seem to gain us efficiency, in as much as the kernel does not need to consult the routing table for every datagram sent. But, in fact, that is not so. Recall that one effect of connect with UDP sockets is that routing information is obtained by the kernel at the time the connect is issued. That information is cached and used for subsequent sends from the connected socket (see p.255).  The client now creates a UDP socket and calls bind on IPclient, with 0 as the port number. This will cause the kernel to bind an ephemeral port to the socket.  After the bind, use the getsockname function (Section 4.10) to obtain IPclient and the ephemeral port number that has been assigned to the socket, and print that information out on stdout, with an appropriate message and appropriately formatted.  The client connects its socket to IPserver and the well-known port number of the server.  After the connect, use the getpeername function (Section 4.10) to obtain IPserver and the well-known port number of the server, and print that information out on stdout, with an appropriate message and appropriately formatted.  The client sends a datagram to the server giving the filename for the transfer. This send needs to be backed up by a timeout in case the datagram is lost.  Note that the incoming datagram from the client will be delivered to the server at the socket to which the destination IP address that the datagram is carrying has been bound. Thus, the server can obtain that address (it is, of course, IPserver) and thereby achieve what IP_RECVDESTADDR would have given us had it been available.  Furthermore, the server process can obtain the IP address (this will, of course, be IPclient) and ephemeral port number of the client through the recvfrom or recvmsg functions.  The server forks off a child process to handle the client. The server parent process goes back to the select to listen for new clients. Hereafter, and unless otherwise stated, whenever we refer to the ‘server’, we mean the server child process handling the client’s file transfer, not the server parent process.  Typically, the first thing the server child would be expected to do is to close all sockets it ‘inherits’ from its parent. However, this is not the case with us. The server child does indeed close the sockets it inherited, but not the socket on which the client request arrived. It leaves that socket open for now. Call this socket the ‘listening’ socket.  The server (child) then checks if the client host is local to its (extended) Ethernet. If so, all its communication to the client is to occur as MSG_DONTROUTE (or SO_DONTROUTE socket option).  If IPserver (obtained in 5. above) is the loopback address, then we are done. Otherwise, the server has to proceed with the following step.  Use the array of structures you built in 1. above, together with the addresses IPserver and IPclient to determine if the client is ‘local’.  Print out on stdout the results of your examination, as to whether the client host is ‘local’ or not. The server (child) creates a UDP socket to handle file transfer to the client. Call this socket the ‘connection’ socket. It binds the socket to IPserver, with port number 0 so that its kernel assigns an ephemeral port.  After the bind, use the getsockname function (Section 4.10) to obtain IPserver and the ephemeral port number that has been assigned to the socket, and print that information out on stdout, with an appropriate message and appropriately formatted.  The server then connects this ‘connection’ socket to the client’s IPclient and ephemeral port number.  The server now sends the client a datagram, in which it passes it the ephemeral port number of its ‘connection’ socket as the data payload of the datagram. This datagram is sent using the ‘listening’ socket inherited from its parent, otherwise the client (whose socket is connected to the server’s ‘listening’ socket at the latter’s well-known port number) will reject it. This datagram must be backed up by the ARQ mechanism, and retransmitted in the event of loss.  Note that if this datagram is indeed lost, the client might well time out and retransmit its original request message (the one carrying the file name). In this event, you must somehow ensure that the parent server does not mistake this retransmitted request for a new client coming in, and spawn off yet another child to handle it. How do you do that? It is potentially more involved than it might seem. I will be discussing this in class, as well as ‘race’ conditions that could potentially arise, depending on how you code the mechanisms I present.  When the client receives the datagram carrying the ephemeral port number of the server’s ‘connection’ socket, it reconnects its socket to the server’s ‘connection’ socket, using IPserver and the ephemeral port number received in the datagram (see p.254). It now uses this reconnected socket to send the server an acknowledgment. Note that this implies that, in the event of the server timing out, it should retransmit two copies of its ‘ephemeral port number’ message, one on its ‘listening’ socket and the other on its ‘connection’ socket (why?).  When the server receives the acknowledgment, it closes the ‘listening’ socket it inherited from its parent. The server can now commence the file transfer through its ‘connection’ socket.  The net effect of all these binds and connects at server and client is that no ‘outsider’ UDP datagram (broadcast, multicast, unicast - fortuitously or maliciously) can now intrude on the communication between server and client.  Starting with the first datagram sent out, the client behaves as follows.  Whenever a datagram arrives, or an ACK is about to be sent out (or, indeed, the initial datagram to the server giving the filename for the transfer), the client uses some random number generator function random() (initialized by the client.in argument value seed) to decide with probability p (another client.in argument value) if the datagram or ACK should be discarded by way of simulating transmission loss across the network. (I will briefly discuss in class how you do this.) Adding reliability to UDP  The mechanisms you are to implement are based on TCP Reno. These include :  Reliable data transmission using ARQ sliding-windows, with Fast Retransmit. Flow control via receiver window advertisements. Congestion control that implements : SlowStart Congestion Avoidance (‘Additive-Increase/Multiplicative Decrease’ – AIMD) Fast Recovery (but without the window-inflation aspect of Fast Recovery) Only some, and by no means all, of the details for these are covered below. The rest will be presented in class, especially those concerning flow control and TCP Reno’s congestion control mechanisms in general :  Slow Start, Congestion Avoidance, Fast Retransmit and Fast Recovery.  Implement a timeout mechanism on the sender (server) side. This is available to you from Stevens, Section 22.5 . Note, however, that you will need to modify the basic driving mechanism of Figure 22.7 appropriately since the situation at the sender side is not a repetitive cycle of send-receive, but rather a straightforward progression of send-send-send-send- . . . . . . . . . . .  Also, modify the RTT and RTO mechanisms of Section 22.5 as specified below. I will be discussing the details of these modifications and the reasons for them in class.  Modify function rtt_stop (Fig. 22.13) so that it uses integer arithmetic rather than floating point. This will entail your also having to modify some of the variable and function parameter declarations throughout Section 22.5 from float to int, as appropriate.  In the unprrt.h header file (Fig. 22.10) set :           RTT_RXTMIN   to 1000 msec.   (1 sec. instead of the current value   3 sec.)           RTT_RXTMAX  to 3000 msec.   (3 sec. instead of the current value 60 sec.)           RTT_MAXNREXMT  to 12        (instead of the current value 3)  In function rtt_timeout (Fig. 22.14), after doubling the RTO in line 86, pass its value through the function rtt_minmax of Fig. 22.11 (somewhat along the lines of what is done in line 77 of rtt_stop, Fig. 22.13).  Finally, note that with the modification to integer calculation of the smoothed RTT and its variation, and given the small RTT values you will experience on the cs / sbpub network, these calculations should probably now be done on a millisecond or even microsecond scale (rather than in seconds, as is the case with Stevens’ code). Otherwise, small measured RTTs could show up as 0 on a scale of seconds, yielding a negative result when we subtract the smoothed RTT from the measured RTT (line 72 of rtt_stop, Fig. 22.13).  Report the details of your modifications to the code of Section 22.5 in the ReadMe file which you hand in with your code.  We need to have a sender sliding window mechanism for the retransmission of lost datagrams; and a receiver sliding window in order to ensure correct sequencing of received file contents, and some measure of flow control. You should implement something based on TCP Reno’s mechanisms, with cumulative acknowledgments, receiver window advertisements, and a congestion control mechanism I will explain in detail in class.  For a reference on TCP’s mechanisms generally, see W. Richard Stevens,   TCP/IP Illustrated, Volume 1 , especially Sections 20.2 - 20.4  of  Chapter 20 ,  and Sections 21.1 - 21.8  of  Chapter 21 .  Bear in mind that our sequence numbers should count datagrams, not bytes as in TCP. Remember that the sender and receiver window sizes have to be set according to the argument values in client.in and server.in, respectively. Whenever the sender window becomes full and so ‘locks’, the server should print out a message to that effect on stdout. Similarly, whenever the receiver window ‘locks’, the client should print out a message on stdout.  Be aware of the potential for deadlock when the receiver window ‘locks’. This situation is handled by having the receiver process send a duplicate ACK which acts as a window update when its window opens again (see  Figure 20.3  and the discussion about it in TCP/IP Illustrated). However, this is not enough, because ACKs are not backed up by a timeout mechanism in the event they are lost. So we will also need to implement a persist timer driving window probes in the sender process (see  Sections 22.1 & 22.2  in Chapter 22 of TCP/IP Illustrated). Note that you do not have to worry about the Silly Window Syndrome discussed in Section 22.3 of TCP/IP Illustrated since the receiver process consumes ‘full sized’ 512-byte messages from the receiver buffer (see 3. below).  Report on the details of the ARQ mechanism you implemented in the ReadMe file you hand in. Indeed, you should report on all the TCP mechanisms you implemented in the ReadMe file, both the ones discussed here, and the ones I will be discussing in class.  Make your datagram payload a fixed 512 bytes, inclusive of the file transfer protocol header (which must, at the very least, carry: the sequence number of the datagram; ACKs; and advertised window notifications).  The client reads the file contents in its receive buffer and prints them out on stdout using a separate thread. This thread sits in a repetitive loop till all the file contents have been printed out, doing the following.  It samples from an exponential distribution with mean µ milliseconds (read from the client.in file), sleeps for that number of milliseconds; wakes up to read and print all in-order file contents available in the receive buffer at that point; samples again from the exponential distribution; sleeps; and so on.  The formula     -1 × µ × ln( random( ) ) ,    where ln is the natural logarithm, yields variates from an exponential distribution with mean µ, based on the uniformly-distributed variates over  ( 0 , 1 )  returned by random().  Note that you will need to implement some sort of mutual exclusion/semaphore mechanism on the client side so that the thread that sleeps and wakes up to consume from the receive buffer is not updating the state variables of the buffer at the same time as the main thread reading from the socket and depositing into the buffer is doing the same. Furthermore, we need to ensure that the main thread does not effectively monopolize the semaphore (and thus lock out for prolonged periods of time) the sleeping thread when the latter wakes up. See the textbook, Section 26.7, ‘Mutexes: Mutual Exclusion’,  pp.697-701. You might also find Section 26.8, ‘Condition Variables’,  pp.701-705, useful.  You will need to devise some way by which the sender can notify the receiver when it has sent the last datagram of the file transfer, without the receiver mistaking that EOF marker as part of the file contents. (Also, note that the last data segment could be a “short” segment of less than 512 bytes – your client needs to be able to handle this correctly somehow.) When the sender receives an ACK for the last datagram of the transfer, the (child) server terminates. The parent server has to take care of cleaning up zombie children.  Note that if we want a clean closing, the client process cannot simply terminate when the receiver ACKs the last datagram. This ACK could be lost, which would leave the (child) server process ‘hanging’, timing out, and retransmitting the last datagram. TCP attempts to deal with this problem by means of the TIME_WAIT state. You should have your receiver process behave similarly, sticking around in something akin to a TIME_WAIT state in case in case it needs to retransmit the ACK.  In the ReadMe file you hand in, report on how you dealt with the issues raised here: sender notifying receiver of the last datagram, clean closing, and so on. Output  Some of the output required from your program has been described in the section Operation above. I expect you to provide further output – clear, well-structured, well-laid-out, concise but sufficient and helpful – in the client and server windows by means of which we can trace the correct evolution of your TCP’s behaviour in all its intricacies :  information (e.g., sequence number) on datagrams and acks sent and dropped, window advertisements, datagram retransmissions (and why :  dup acks or RTO); entering/exiting Slow Start and Congestion Avoidance, ssthresh and cwnd values; sender and receiver windows locking/unlocking; etc., etc. . . .  .  The onus is on you to convince us that the TCP mechanisms you implemented are working correctly. Too many students do not put sufficient thought, creative imagination, time or effort into this. It is not the TA’s nor my responsibility to sit staring at an essentially blank screen, trying to summon up our paranormal psychology skills to figure out if your TCP implementation is really working correctly in all its very intricate aspects, simply because the transferred file seems to be printing o.k. in the client window. Nor is it our responsibility to strain our eyes and our patience wading through a mountain of obscure, ill-structured, hyper-messy, debugging-style output because, for example, your effort-conserving concept of what is ‘suitable’ is to dump your debugging output on us, relevant, irrelevant, and everything in between.",2015-04-10T18:37:13Z,2015-04-10 18:37:13,,4,0,160,1,0,0,0.0,2276,10,2286,

Rotating polygons, and Making Java Executable.  Model View Controller (MVC) The Model is the class that contains the data and the methods needed to use the data. The View is the interface. The Controller coordinates interactions between the Model and View.  DESIGN PATTERNS:  Strategy design patternis used if you need to dynamically change an algorithm used by an object at run time. The pattern also allows you to eliminate code duplication. It separates behavior from super and subclasses.  The Observer pattern is a software design pattern in which an object, called the subject (Publisher), maintains a list of its dependents, called observers (Subscribers), and notifies them automatically of any state changes, usually by calling one of their methods.  The Factory design pattern is used when you want to define the class of an object at runtime. It also allows you to encapsulate object creation so that you can keep all object creation code in one place  The Abstract Factory Design Pattern is like a factory, but everything is encapsulated.  The Singleton pattern is used when you want to eliminate the option of instantiating more than one object. (Scrabble letters app)  The Builder Design Pattern is used when you want to have many classes help in the creation of an object. By having different classes build the object you can then easily create many different types of objects without being forced to rewrite code. The Builder pattern provides a different way to make complex objects like you'd make using the Abstract Factory design pattern.  The Prototype design pattern is used for creating new objects (instances) by cloning (copying) other objects. It allows for the adding of any subclass instance of a known super class at run time. It is used when there are numerous potential classes that you want to only use if needed at runtime. The major benefit of using the Prototype pattern is that it reduces the need for creating potentially unneeded subclasses.  Java Reflection is an API and it's used to manipulate classes and everything in a class including fields, methods, constructors, private data, etc. (TestingReflection.java)  The Decorator allows you to modify an object dynamically. You would use it when you want the capabilities of inheritance with subclasses, but you need to add functionality at run time. It is more flexible than inheritance. The Decorator Design Pattern simplifies code because you add functionality using many simple classes. Also, rather than rewrite old code you can extend it with new code and that is always good. (Pizza app)  The Command design pattern allows you to store a list of commands for later use. With it you can store multiple commands in a class to use over and over. (ElectronicDevice app)  The Adapter pattern is used when you want to translate one interface of a class into another interface. Allows 2 incompatible interfaces to work together. It allows the use of the available interface and the target interface. Any class can work together as long as the Adapter solves the issue that all classes must implement every method defined by the shared interface. (EnemyAttacker app)   The Facade pattern basically says that you should simplify your methods so that much of what is done is in the background. In technical terms you should decouple the client from the sub components needed to perform an operation. (Bank app)  The Bridge Pattern is used to decouple an abstraction from its implementation so that the two can vary independently. Progressively adding functionality while separating out major differences using abstract classes. (EntertainmentDevice app)  In a Template Method pattern, you define a method (algorithm) in an abstract class. It contains both abstract methods and non-abstract methods. The subclasses that extend this abstract class then override those methods that don't make sense for them to use in the default way. (Sandwich app)  The Iterator pattern provides you with a uniform way to access different collections of Objects. You can also write polymorphic code because you can refer to each collection of objects because they'll implement the same interface. (SongIterator app)  The Composite design pattern is used to structure data into its individual parts as well as represent the inner workings of every part of a larger object. The composite pattern also allows you to treat both groups of parts in the same way as you treat the parts polymorphically. You can structure data, or represent the inner working of every part of a whole object individually. (SongComponent app)  The flyweight design pattern is used to dramatically increase the speed of your code when you are using many similar objects. To reduce memory usage the flyweight design pattern shares Objects that are the same rather than creating new ones. (FlyWeightTest app)  State Pattern allows an object to alter its behavior when its internal state changes. The object will appear to change its class. (ATMState)  The Proxy design pattern limits access to just the methods you want made accessible in another class. It can be used for security reasons, because an Object is intensive to create, or is accessed from a remote location. You can think of it as a gate keeper that blocks access to another Object. (TestATMMachine)  The Chain of Responsibility pattern has a group of objects that are expected to between them be able to solve a problem. If the first Object can't solve it, it passes the data to the next Object in the chain. (TestCalcChain)  The Interpreter pattern is used to convert one representation of data into another. The context cantains the information that will be interpreted. The expression is an abstract class that defines all the methods needed to perform the different conversions. The terminal or concrete expressions provide specific conversions on different types of data. (MeasurementConversion)  The Mediator design pattern is used to handle communication between related objects (Colleagues). All communication is handled by a Mediator Object and the Colleagues don't need to know anything about each other to work together. (TestStockMediator)  The Memento design pattern provides a way to store previous states of an Object easily. It has 3 main classes: 1) Memento: The basic object that is stored in different states.  2) Originator: Sets and Gets values from the currently targeted Memento. Creates new Mementos and assigns current values to them.  3) Caretaker: Holds an ArrayList that contains all previous versions of the Memento. It can store and retrieve stored Mementos. (TestMemento)  The Visitor design pattern allows you to add methods to classes of different types without much altering to those classes. You can make completely different methods depending on the class used with this pattern. (VisitorTest)",2016-10-04T17:14:10Z,2016-10-04 17:17:27,,2,0,11444,2,0,0,0.0,73802,0,73802,

(Please read the lecture notes for setting up the JSP tag library.)  --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  Part II:  1. Develop JSP  Design and develop Java JSPs to process the Book client requests.  1. Develop a dbConnection JavaBean class that will be used to connect to the Book database.   You may call the dbConnection from a JSP using <java:useBean ...>  (Use a Http session in the JSP to store the database login, password, and database connection.)  2. Develop a dbQuery JSP to process the data query request from the client.  You should try to create the similar GUI as in the previous assignments.   The JSP should use a custom tag to process the data query from the database to hide the SQL operation details.  The custom tag should use the same database connection object stored in the Http session. 3. Develop a dbUpdate JSP to process the data update request from the client. You should try to create the similar GUI as in the previous assignments.  The JSP should use a custom tag to process the data update from the database to hide the SQL operation details.    - The custom tag should use the same database connection object stored in the Http session. 2. Deploy and Test the Three-Tier JSP Client-Servlet/Custom Tags Server-Database System  Combine the above into a three-tier client/application server/database application.

Rotating polygons, and Making Java Executable.  Model View Controller (MVC) The Model is the class that contains the data and the methods needed to use the data. The View is the interface. The Controller coordinates interactions between the Model and View.  DESIGN PATTERNS:  Strategy design patternis used if you need to dynamically change an algorithm used by an object at run time. The pattern also allows you to eliminate code duplication. It separates behavior from super and subclasses.  The Observer pattern is a software design pattern in which an object, called the subject (Publisher), maintains a list of its dependents, called observers (Subscribers), and notifies them automatically of any state changes, usually by calling one of their methods.  The Factory design pattern is used when you want to define the class of an object at runtime. It also allows you to encapsulate object creation so that you can keep all object creation code in one place  The Abstract Factory Design Pattern is like a factory, but everything is encapsulated.  The Singleton pattern is used when you want to eliminate the option of instantiating more than one object. (Scrabble letters app)  The Builder Design Pattern is used when you want to have many classes help in the creation of an object. By having different classes build the object you can then easily create many different types of objects without being forced to rewrite code. The Builder pattern provides a different way to make complex objects like you'd make using the Abstract Factory design pattern.  The Prototype design pattern is used for creating new objects (instances) by cloning (copying) other objects. It allows for the adding of any subclass instance of a known super class at run time. It is used when there are numerous potential classes that you want to only use if needed at runtime. The major benefit of using the Prototype pattern is that it reduces the need for creating potentially unneeded subclasses.  Java Reflection is an API and it's used to manipulate classes and everything in a class including fields, methods, constructors, private data, etc. (TestingReflection.java)  The Decorator allows you to modify an object dynamically. You would use it when you want the capabilities of inheritance with subclasses, but you need to add functionality at run time. It is more flexible than inheritance. The Decorator Design Pattern simplifies code because you add functionality using many simple classes. Also, rather than rewrite old code you can extend it with new code and that is always good. (Pizza app)  The Command design pattern allows you to store a list of commands for later use. With it you can store multiple commands in a class to use over and over. (ElectronicDevice app)  The Adapter pattern is used when you want to translate one interface of a class into another interface. Allows 2 incompatible interfaces to work together. It allows the use of the available interface and the target interface. Any class can work together as long as the Adapter solves the issue that all classes must implement every method defined by the shared interface. (EnemyAttacker app)   The Facade pattern basically says that you should simplify your methods so that much of what is done is in the background. In technical terms you should decouple the client from the sub components needed to perform an operation. (Bank app)  The Bridge Pattern is used to decouple an abstraction from its implementation so that the two can vary independently. Progressively adding functionality while separating out major differences using abstract classes. (EntertainmentDevice app)  In a Template Method pattern, you define a method (algorithm) in an abstract class. It contains both abstract methods and non-abstract methods. The subclasses that extend this abstract class then override those methods that don't make sense for them to use in the default way. (Sandwich app)  The Iterator pattern provides you with a uniform way to access different collections of Objects. You can also write polymorphic code because you can refer to each collection of objects because they'll implement the same interface. (SongIterator app)  The Composite design pattern is used to structure data into its individual parts as well as represent the inner workings of every part of a larger object. The composite pattern also allows you to treat both groups of parts in the same way as you treat the parts polymorphically. You can structure data, or represent the inner working of every part of a whole object individually. (SongComponent app)  The flyweight design pattern is used to dramatically increase the speed of your code when you are using many similar objects. To reduce memory usage the flyweight design pattern shares Objects that are the same rather than creating new ones. (FlyWeightTest app)  State Pattern allows an object to alter its behavior when its internal state changes. The object will appear to change its class. (ATMState)  The Proxy design pattern limits access to just the methods you want made accessible in another class. It can be used for security reasons, because an Object is intensive to create, or is accessed from a remote location. You can think of it as a gate keeper that blocks access to another Object. (TestATMMachine)  The Chain of Responsibility pattern has a group of objects that are expected to between them be able to solve a problem. If the first Object can't solve it, it passes the data to the next Object in the chain. (TestCalcChain)  The Interpreter pattern is used to convert one representation of data into another. The context cantains the information that will be interpreted. The expression is an abstract class that defines all the methods needed to perform the different conversions. The terminal or concrete expressions provide specific conversions on different types of data. (MeasurementConversion)  The Mediator design pattern is used to handle communication between related objects (Colleagues). All communication is handled by a Mediator Object and the Colleagues don't need to know anything about each other to work together. (TestStockMediator)  The Memento design pattern provides a way to store previous states of an Object easily. It has 3 main classes: 1) Memento: The basic object that is stored in different states.  2) Originator: Sets and Gets values from the currently targeted Memento. Creates new Mementos and assigns current values to them.  3) Caretaker: Holds an ArrayList that contains all previous versions of the Memento. It can store and retrieve stored Mementos. (TestMemento)  The Visitor design pattern allows you to add methods to classes of different types without much altering to those classes. You can make completely different methods depending on the class used with this pattern. (VisitorTest)",2016-10-04T17:14:10Z,2016-10-04 17:17:27,,2,0,11444,2,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,

10:54:297759浏览2评论 作为IT届的小弟，本篇作为本人的第一篇手记，还希望各位大牛多多指点，以下均为个人学习所得，如有错误，敬请指正。本着服务IT小白的原则，该手记比较详细。由于最近使用postgre开发大型项目，发现了关系型数据库的弊端及查询效率之慢，苦心钻研之下，对nosql的mongoDB从无知到有了初步了解。  项目环境：win10+IntelliJ IDEA2016+maven3.3.9+MongoDB 3.2+JDK1.7+spring4.1.7  推荐网站（适合学习各种知识的基础）：http://www.runoob.com/ mongo安装请参考http://www.runoob.com/mongodb/mongodb-window-install.html  由于最近osChina的maven仓库挂掉，推荐大家使用阿里的镜像，速度快的飞起 maven配置：<localRepository>F:\.m2\repository</localRepository>  <mirrors>     <mirror>       <id>alimaven</id>       <name>aliyun maven</name>

这里dao与mongoDao分别为mongoDB的两种查询方式： dao为JPA的查询方式（请参考springdataJPA） mongoDao使用mongoTemplate，类似于关系型数据库使用的jdbcTemplate  不罗嗦，上代码 先看配置文件 spring-context.xm为最基本的spring配置  <?xml version=""1.0""

JPA的dao，注意这里只要继承MongoRepository不用写注解spring就能认识这是个Repository，MongoRepository提供了基本的增删改查，不用实现便可直接调用，例如testMongo的personDao.save(persons);  public interface PersonDao extends MongoRepository<Person, ObjectId> {      @Query(value = ""{'age' : {'$gte' : ?0, '$lte' : ?1}, 'name':?2 }"",fields=""{ 'name' : 1, 'age' : 1}"")     List<Person> findByAge(int age1, int age2, String name);  } mongoTemplate的dao  /**  * Created by DuLida on 2016/10/21.  */ public interface PersonMongoDao {      List<Person> findAll();      void insertPerson(Person user);      void removePerson(String userName);      void updatePerson();      List<Person> findForRequery(String userName); } @Repository(""personMongoImpl"") public class PersonMongoImpl implements PersonMongoDao {      @Resource     private MongoTemplate mongoTemplate;      @Override     public List<Person> findAll() {         return mongoTemplate.findAll(Person.class,""person"");     }      @Override     public void insertPerson(Person person) {         mongoTemplate.insert(person,""person"");     }      @Override     public void removePerson(String userName) {         mongoTemplate.remove(Query.query(Criteria.where(""name"").is(userName)),""person"");     }      @Override     public void updatePerson() {         mongoTemplate.updateMulti(Query.query(Criteria.where(""age"").gt(3).lte(5)), Update.update(""age"",3),""person"");     }      @Override     public List<Person> findForRequery(String userName) {         return mongoTemplate.find(Query.query(Criteria.where(""name"").is(userName)),Person.class);     } } JPA查询的测试类：  /**  * Created by DuLida on 2016/10/20.  */ @RunWith(SpringJUnit4ClassRunner.class) //告诉junit spring配置文件 @ContextConfiguration({""classpath:spring/spring-context.xml"",""classpath:spring/spring-mongo.xml""}) public class PersonDaoTest {      @Resource     private PersonDao personDao;      /*先往数据库中插入10个person*/     @Test     public void testMongo() {         List<Person> persons = new ArrayList<Person>();         for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {            persons.add(new Person(""name""+i,i,new Address(""石家庄"",""裕华路"",i)));         }         personDao.save(persons);     }      @Test     public void findMongo() {         System.out.println(personDao.findByAge(2,8,""name6""));      }  } mongoTemplate查询的测试类  /**  * Created by DuLida on 2016/10/21.  */ @RunWith(SpringJUnit4ClassRunner.class) //告诉junit spring配置文件 @ContextConfiguration({""classpath:spring/spring-context.xml"",""classpath:spring/spring-mongo.xml""}) public class MongoTemplateTest {      @Resource     private PersonMongoImpl personMongo;      @Test     public void testMongoTemplate() {          //personMongo.insertPerson(new Person(""wukong"",24,new Address(""石家庄"",""鑫达路"",20)));         //personMongo.removePerson(""name3"");         //personMongo.updatePerson();         //System.out.println(personMongo.findAll());         System.out.println(personMongo.findForRequery(""wukong""));     } } 注意测试前请先通过testMongo()向数据库中插入数据。

DhananjayGupta300,DevOps-Workflow-for-Automatically-Building-and-Analyzing-Software-Applications,"This project simulates the DevOps environment from developers pushing their code to automated building, testing and analyzing of code. Our Java project simulates this process by downloading repositories from GitHub, uploading each repository to a local GitLab server, which triggers the build process and code analysis in the locally installed Jenkins server. Our Jenkins server configuration built, tested and analyzed project code using JaCoCo and Understand. Our implementation of the DevOps environment focused on Java Maven applications containing unit tests and JaCoCo support. The project is implemented in Java and built with Gradle. GitHub, GitLab, and Jenkins Java APIs are used to access GitHub.com, the local GitLab server, and the local Jenkins server from the Main.java file. The JGit Java library is used for git repository management within our project. These dependencies are documented in the build.gradle file. We were able to successfully perform a stress test of our Java application by pushing 54 Github projects through our DevOps simulation without error. From the execution of our application to the last job being built in Jenkins, it took approximately 20 minutes. 25 out of the 54 applications built successfully some of which had included JaCoCo code coverage, unit testing results, and produced Understand code analysis. The remaining 29 failed for a variety of reasons such as missing pom.xml build file, failed unit tests, missing plugins, etc. Please note that our application only pulls the first 100 repository results of our GitHub.com query due to GitHub API limitations. Despite this GitHub API limitation, during our stress test we found that 100 repositories was enough to produce a sufficient number of successful builds.",2018-03-21T19:57:41Z,2018-03-21 20:11:25,,8,0,283,1,389,389,12.97,1055,295,1350,

jeevanpopinjay,Embedded-SQL-in-C,"Embedded-SQL-in-C  The program uses Embedded SQL statements in C to access the database created using PostgreSQL  Using Empedded SQL in C (ecpg),  Program takes input such as the SSN of employee, project number, hours for the project, and salary for the employee. Firstly, it lists the employee’s name, employee’s department name, salary, and the number of dependents. Then for each project the employee is working, provide a list of <the project number, the project name, the name of the department manager controlling the project, the number of hours the employee is working on the project, the number of employees working on the project, the total number of hours for the project (by all employees)>. After providing the current status related with the employee, update the number of hours worked by the employee for the project as follows. (Update/Insert/Delete) If the employee is already working on that project, the number of hours will be updated; otherwise a new tuple will be inserted. The program should input the project number, each employee’s SSN and the number of hours from the command line. If the number of hours is 0, the tuple is deleted. (Update) If the hours are updated, your program should print an update message (e.g., “The number of hours for employee ‘John B Smith’ on project ‘ProductX’ is updated from 32.5 to 30.”). (Insert) Otherwise an insert message should be printed (e.g., “Employee ‘John B Smith’ started to work on 5 hours on project ‘ProductZ’.”). (Delete) Note that if the number of hours is set to 0, it means the corresponding tuple should be deleted if it already exists (e.g., “Employee ‘John B Smith’ who was working on 5 hours on project ‘ProductZ’ stopped working on this project.”). The parameters will be read from the command line. The message must include the employee name, project name, number of hours, and previous number of hours if applicable.

It should be designed in sucha way that all queries/data retrievals on/from the database run efficiently and effectively. - Produce DDL SQL statements for creating the corresponding tables in a relational DBMS. Note the constraints, including key constraints, referential integrity constraints, not NULL constraints, etc. needed for the relational schema to capture and enforce the semantics of your ER design. - Populate your database with the Yelp data. Generate INSERT statements for your tables and run those to insert data into your DB. II. Part 2 Implement the application for searching local businesses as explained in section “Overview & Requirements”. In this milestone you would: - Write the SQL queries to search your database. - Establish connectivity with the DBMS. - Embed/execute queries in/from the code. Retrieve query results and parse the returned results to generate the output that will be displayed on the GUI. - Implement a GUI where the user can, o browse through main and sub-categories for the businesses; select the business categories that user wants to search for; (note: The list of the main categories is given in Appendix-C. All other categories that appear in the business objects are sub-categories. Such a distinction is made for easier browsing of the business categories.) o browse through theattributes of theselected categories ;specify the attributes she/he is interested in; o search for the businesses that belong to the main and sub-categories that user specifies and have the attributes that user selects, (The user should be able to search for the businesses that have either all the attributes (AND condition) or that have any of the attributes specified (ORcondition)) o filteroutthesearchresultsforaspecificstate,city,orzipcode, o filteroutthebusinesseswhichareopenorclosedonspecificdaysoftheweek, o selectacertainbusinessinthesearchresultsandlistallthereviewsforthatbusiness.(note:The review list should also include the names of the users who provided thosereviews)",2016-02-24T19:54:30Z,2016-02-25 06:21:36,,4,0,32,1,54,54,1.8,2032,2,2034,

houcembenmahfoudh,Sapere,"This project is intended to provide a demonstrator testbed for spatial edges services running on the SAPERE middleware.Spatial edge services are a new generation of services that exploit spatially distributed data, enable smart environments, or exploit Internet of Things (IoT) scenarios. This new category of decentralized services is based on data propagation among devices. The functionality of the service is provided as the result of collective interactions among multiple agent-based entities, involving processes and calculations taking place across several geographically distributed computational nodes. Spatial edge services rely on a coordination model for multi-agent pervasive systems inspired by chemical reactions. The SAPERE middleware is an implementation of a chemical coordination model enabling spatial edge services. There is currently no version of the SAPERE middleware adapted for devices with small computational capacities, such as connected objects. The goal of this project is to provide a new version of SAPERE middleware adapted to connected objects, integrate the middleware to the actual IoT infrastructure available in Hepia and provide a testbed for several spatial edge services case-study.",2017-07-11T11:11:09Z,2017-07-11 11:14:26,,5,0,496,1,77,77,2.57,99594,11,99605,

Sidharth15BCE0075,Analysis-on-Task-Allocation-and-Load-Balancing-in-Distributed-Systems,"Distributed systems are the distributed computational units which are connected and organized by networks to meet the demand of large-scale and high performance computing that have received considerable attention over the past decades. There are many types of distributed systems, such as grids, peer-to-peer systems, ad hoc networks, cloud computing systems, pervasive computing systems, and online social network systems. In past decades there are significant amount of studies for this area, which could cause people to be puzzled by the enormous amount of wide variety of research results. Although there have been some related surveys previously, but most of which only made a very preliminary review on the state of art of one single type of distributed system, such as the survey of load balancing in grids, the survey of load balancing in cloud computing, and the survey of load balancing in P2P systems. Then, how to correlate the related studies in varying types of distributed systems and make a general taxonomy on them? To solve the above problem, first this analysis of this paper summarizes the typical characteristics of general distributed systems, such as the distributed control, resource distribution, open environments, heterogeneous nodes, and network structures. Then, the analysis of this paper categorizes the existing studies on task allocation and load balancing based on how they can satisfy the characteristics of distributed systems, which includes the following aspects: control models, resource optimization, ensuring reliability, coordination mechanisms, and measures to consider network structures. With this analysis, a general and macroscopic review of task allocation and load balancing for varying types of distributed systems can be achieved, which can have higher generality much than the previous preliminary surveys for only one single type of systems",2017-11-11T05:01:17Z,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,0,0,

The implementation was done in three different ways : 1. Flora - 2 :  an open source rule-based system for knowledge representation and reasoning. The language of the system is derived from F-logic, HiLog, and Transaction logic. Being based on F-logic and HiLog implies that object-oriented syntax and higher-order representation are the major features of the system. 2. object- relational extensions of SQL — whatever is supported by PostgreSQL. Using Java/JSP/Servlets to build an application front end to your database. Database connectivity should be done using Java/JDBC. 3.
