```python
import os
from fabric import Connection

def deploy_billing_calculator():
    repo_url = "https://github.com/your-organization/billing-calculator.git"
    staging_server = "staging.example.com"
    user = "deployuser"

    with Connection(host=staging_server, user=user) as conn:
        conn.run(f'mkdir -p ~/apps/{os.path.basename(repo_url)}')
        conn.run(f'cd ~/apps/{os.path.basename(repo_url)}; git clone {repo_url}')
        # Assuming you have a custom script to install and run the billing calculator
        # Replace 'start-billing-calculator.sh' with your actual script path
        conn.run(f'cd ~/apps/{os.path.basename(repo_url)} && ./start-billing-calculator.sh')

deploy_billing_calculator()
```

This script assumes you have Fabric installed and configured for the staging server, and a script named 'start-billing-calculator.sh' in the root directory of your billing calculator repository to handle installation and running the application.
