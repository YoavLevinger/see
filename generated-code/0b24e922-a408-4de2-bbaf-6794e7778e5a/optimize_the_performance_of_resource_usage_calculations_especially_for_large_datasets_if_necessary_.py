```python
import numpy as np

def batch_resource_usage(data, batch_size=10000):
    total = 0
    for i in range(0, len(data), batch_size):
        batch = data[i:i+batch_size]
        resources = calculate_resources(batch)
        total += resources
    return total

def calculate_resources(data):
    # Optimized resource usage calculation for large datasets (e.g., using vectorized operations with numpy)
    # Replace this function with your custom implementation
    pass
```

In the provided code, the `batch_resource_usage` function calculates the total resource usage of a large dataset by processing it in batches. This approach can significantly reduce memory usage when dealing with very large datasets, as only small portions of data need to be loaded into memory at any given time.

The `calculate_resources` function is where you should implement your custom optimization for resource usage calculation. It takes a batch of data and returns the corresponding resource usage. The example I provided leaves this function empty, waiting for your implementation.
