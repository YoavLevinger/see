### **1. Algorithms with Better Potential:**
These algorithms could improve the **accuracy and robustness** of software effort estimation.

#### **A. Transformer-based Text Embeddings (Best Alternative to PVA)**
- **Why?**  
  - PVA (Paragraph Vector Algorithm) is good, but **transformer-based models like BERT, RoBERTa, or Sentence-BERT (SBERT)** would generate **better** embeddings for software descriptions.
  - These models capture **semantic meaning** better than PVA.
- **Potential Improvement:**  
  - Could **increase accuracy from 87.26% to ~92-95%** in similarity detection.
  - Better **handling of synonyms and contextual meaning** in software descriptions.

#### **B. k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN) with Transformer Embeddings**
- **Why?**  
  - kNN was mentioned in the research as an alternative but wasn't used.
  - kNN on top of **better embeddings (from SBERT/RoBERTa)** would improve similar software project retrieval.
- **Potential Improvement:**  
  - Helps detect **better matches** for effort estimation.
  - If paired with a **weighted similarity approach**, could refine the top-k matches.

#### **C. Random Forest or XGBoost for Effort Prediction**
- **Why?**  
  - Current estimation uses **Walkerden’s Triangle Function**, which is a **simple weighted average method**.
  - **Random Forest/XGBoost** would learn **non-linear** relationships between **similar projects’ effort values** and **developer activity features**.
- **Potential Improvement:**  
  - Could **reduce mean absolute error (MAE)** significantly.
  - Learns **complex dependencies** in effort estimation beyond just averaging.

#### **D. Neural Network-Based Regression**
- **Why?**  
  - The research **didn’t use neural networks (like MLPs, Transformers, or LSTMs)** for prediction.
  - Training a **simple Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP)** on top of **PVA/SBERT embeddings** and **developer activity data** would improve the effort estimation.
- **Potential Improvement:**  
  - Could outperform **Walkerden’s Triangle Function** by **learning from multiple software projects dynamically**.

### **2. Potential New Model Architecture**
If you want a **better effort estimation pipeline**, you could structure it like this:

1. **Text Embedding (Replace PVA)**
   - **Use SBERT/RoBERTa instead of PVA** for representing software descriptions.
   - **Alternative:** Use **TF-IDF + Word2Vec hybrid** if deep learning isn't an option.

2. **Similar Project Retrieval**
   - Use **Cosine Similarity on SBERT embeddings** (better than PVA-based similarity).
   - **Alternative:** Try **kNN (k = 5 or 10) on embedding space**.

3. **Effort Estimation Model**
   - Instead of **Walkerden’s Triangle Function**, try:
     - **Random Forest/XGBoost** (good interpretability)
     - **Neural Network Regression (MLP/LSTM/Transformer)**

### **3. Expected Benefits of These Changes**
| Change                                | Potential Gain |
|---------------------------------------|---------------|
| **SBERT/RoBERTa for embeddings**      | +5-8% accuracy in software matching |
| **kNN with better embeddings**        | More relevant similar projects |
| **Random Forest/XGBoost for effort**  | Better non-linear relationship learning |
| **Neural Network Regression**         | Dynamic learning, higher accuracy |

---

### **4. Final Recommendation**
- **only change one thing**, **replace PVA with SBERT/RoBERTa embeddings**.  
- **want maximum improvement**, use a **full pipeline upgrade** (SBERT + kNN + XGBoost/MLP).
