## **üìå How SDEE Data Can Be Used for Effort Estimation Methods**
The **SDEE dataset** contains two key components:
1. **Developer Activity Metrics** (e.g., `devCount`, `activDays`, `modLOC`, `effort`).
2. **Software Description Similarity** (`pv_vec`, `cos_sim`).

The **research document** presents several **machine learning, statistical, and heuristic-based** effort estimation models. Below, we assess which of these models can be implemented using the **SDEE data**.
