### **1. Explanation of the Algorithms**

#### **DevSDEE (Developer Activity-Based Software Development Effort Estimation)**
- **Concept**: This method estimates effort by leveraging software features similarity and developer activity-based metrics extracted from GitHub repositories. It uses a **Paragraph Vector Algorithm (PVA)** to analyze textual descriptions of software and find similar projects.
- **Key Features**:
  - Uses **developer activity information** (e.g., commits, contributors, time spent).
  - **Software similarity detection model** trained on GitHub repository descriptions.
  - Computes effort based on **developer count** and **development time**.
- **Formula**:
  - \( effort = developer\_count \times development\_time \)
  - Similarity detection: **Cosine similarity** between software descriptions.
- **Strengths**: Achieves **87.26% accuracy** in effort estimation.

---

#### **LOC Straw Man (Lines of Code-Based Effort Estimation)**
- **Concept**: This method estimates software development effort based solely on the **lines of code (LOC)** modified in a repository.
- **Key Features**:
  - Uses **LOC as the primary effort indicator**.
  - **More LOC → Higher estimated effort**.
  - Simple but often **inaccurate**, as LOC does not always correlate with effort.
- **Formula**:
  - \( effort = f(LOC) \), where \( f \) is an empirical function mapping LOC to effort.
- **Strengths**:
  - Works well for large-scale projects with similar development environments.
  - Simple and easy to implement.
- **Weaknesses**:
  - Ignores developer productivity and project complexity.
  - Lower accuracy (84.22%).

---

#### **ATLM (Automatically Transformed Linear Model)**
- **Concept**: ATLM is a **linear regression-based model** that automatically transforms input variables (metadata and historical project effort values) to fit a linear equation.
- **Key Features**:
  - Uses **historical effort estimation data** and **project metadata**.
  - Performs **automated feature transformation**.
  - **Regression-based**: Fits a linear model to predict effort.
- **Formula**:
  - \( effort = \beta_0 + \beta_1 X_1 + \beta_2 X_2 + ... + \beta_n X_n + \epsilon \)
  - Where:
    - \( X_i \) = independent variables (e.g., LOC, developer count, commits).
    - \( \beta_i \) = learned coefficients.
    - \( \epsilon \) = error term.
- **Strengths**:
  - Works well when historical project data is available.
  - **More robust than LOC Straw Man** but less flexible than ML-based approaches.
- **Weaknesses**:
  - **Lower accuracy (42.7%)**.
  - Performance depends on how well historical data represents new projects.

---

#### **ABE (Analogy-Based Estimation)**
- **Concept**: This method predicts effort by identifying similar past projects (based on metadata or effort values) and using their effort data for estimation.
- **Key Features**:
  - Uses **k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN)** to find similar past projects.
  - Computes **weighted Euclidean distance** between feature vectors.
  - Predicts effort using a weighted average of similar projects.
- **Formula**:
  - **Similarity metric**:
    - \( distance(X, Y) = \sqrt{\sum_{i=1}^{n} w_i (X_i - Y_i)^2} \)
  - **Effort estimation**:
    - \( effort = \sum_{i=1}^{k} w_i \cdot effort_i / \sum_{i=1}^{k} w_i \)
- **Strengths**:
  - **Works well when similar past projects exist**.
  - Handles **nonlinear patterns** better than ATLM.
- **Weaknesses**:
  - Sensitive to feature scaling and **data sparsity**.
  - Performance drops when past projects **differ significantly** from new ones.

## **2. Implementation of Each Algorithm Using "sdee_lite.sql"**

### **A. Implementing DevSDEE**
1. **Extract developer activity metrics**:
   ```sql
   SELECT repo_id, dev_count, development_time, commit_count 
   FROM sdee_lite;
   ```
2. **Compute effort estimates**:
   ```sql
   SELECT repo_id, (dev_count * development_time) AS effort_estimate 
   FROM sdee_lite;
   ```
3. **Implement software similarity detection** using PVA:
   - Convert **software descriptions** into vectors.
   - Compute **cosine similarity** to find similar projects.
   - Use **top-3 similar projects’ effort** for final estimation:
   ```sql
   SELECT repo_id, similarity_score, effort_estimate
   FROM sdee_lite
   WHERE similarity_score > 0.8
   ORDER BY similarity_score DESC
   LIMIT 3;
   ```

---

### **B. Implementing LOC Straw Man**
1. **Extract LOC metrics**:
   ```sql
   SELECT repo_id, loc_modified FROM sdee_lite;
   ```
2. **Estimate effort using a linear function**:
   ```sql
   SELECT repo_id, (loc_modified * 0.1) AS effort_estimate 
   FROM sdee_lite;
   ```
   *(Assuming 1 LOC = 0.1 person-hours as an empirical factor)*

---

### **C. Implementing ATLM**
1. **Extract relevant features for regression**:
   ```sql
   SELECT repo_id, dev_count, loc_modified, development_time, commit_count, effort_estimate 
   FROM sdee_lite;
   ```
2. **Train a regression model in Python**:
   ```python
   import pandas as pd
   from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression

   # Load data
   df = pd.read_sql("SELECT * FROM sdee_lite", connection)

   # Define features and target variable
   X = df[['dev_count', 'loc_modified', 'development_time', 'commit_count']]
   y = df['effort_estimate']

   # Train model
   model = LinearRegression()
   model.fit(X, y)

   # Predict effort
   df['predicted_effort'] = model.predict(X)
   ```
3. **Store predictions in SQL**:
   ```sql
   UPDATE sdee_lite SET effort_estimate = ? WHERE repo_id = ?;
   ```

---

### **D. Implementing ABE (Analogy-Based Estimation)**
1. **Extract past projects’ data for similarity calculation**:
   ```sql
   SELECT repo_id, dev_count, loc_modified, development_time, commit_count, effort_estimate 
   FROM sdee_lite;
   ```
2. **Compute weighted Euclidean distance (in Python)**:
   ```python
   from sklearn.neighbors import NearestNeighbors
   import numpy as np

   # Prepare data
   X = df[['dev_count', 'loc_modified', 'development_time', 'commit_count']].values
   y = df['effort_estimate'].values

   # Fit k-NN model
   knn = NearestNeighbors(n_neighbors=3, metric='euclidean')
   knn.fit(X)

   # Find top 3 similar projects
   distances, indices = knn.kneighbors(X)

   # Compute weighted effort estimate
   weights = 1 / (distances + 0.001)  # Avoid division by zero
   predicted_effort = np.sum(y[indices] * weights, axis=1) / np.sum(weights, axis=1)
   ```
3. **Store predicted effort back to SQL**:
   ```sql
   UPDATE sdee_lite SET effort_estimate = ? WHERE repo_id = ?;
   ```

---

## **Conclusion**
Each algorithm processes *sdee_lite.sql* differently:
- **DevSDEE**: Uses **developer activity and software similarity**.
- **LOC Straw Man**: Simple **lines-of-code-based effort estimation**.
- **ATLM**: **Regression-based model** using historical effort data.
- **ABE**: **Similarity-based estimation** using k-NN on past projects.

**DevSDEE is the most accurate (87.26%), but ATLM and ABE can be improved by integrating machine learning techniques.**
